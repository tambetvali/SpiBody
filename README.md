In this repository, I contain some spiritual hints for physical training. Initially, I have a very short texts.

Goals for training:
- Using holistic perspective of whole-body training, make your everyday activities, such as opening doors or eating, or walking, more fluent and seamless.
- Train your body to express, protect, etc.

Efficiency in everyday activities and your work or parties is especially good - by addressing real-life issues you actually benefit from the training. For long-term effort you need to be able to do the same things
with different muscle groups so that you can switch as you get tired or preferrably in response to small changes in the task.
