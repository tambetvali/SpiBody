In this repository, I contain some spiritual hints for physical training. Initially, I have a very short texts.

Goals for training:
- Using holistic perspective of whole-body training, make your everyday activities, such as opening doors or eating, or walking, more fluent and seamless.
- Train your body to express, protect, etc.

Efficiency in everyday activities and your work or parties is especially good - by addressing real-life issues you actually benefit from the training. For long-term effort you need to be able to do the same things
with different muscle groups so that you can switch as you get tired or preferrably in response to small changes in the task.

This is the set of guidelines made by AI from [my simplistic set of rules](holisticbody.md):

I do train by intuition and logic, based on simple set of rules, axioms, intuitions. While knowing exercises to address different parts is good, you can also flow with the intuition to create basic, firm strength (for work or pleasure) for the movements. Your muscles, organs and abilities can be trained with physical movement - in body training, somehow, with yoga, you seem to train physical activities, but instead you feel their connectedness with vitamin production, magic skills or temperaments. Instead of raising the strength indefinitely, you add to each quality and especially reach the destination where each part is doing it's work - this way, you are not adding to quantities, but you get new qualities, layers and even structures of your body (for example, what seems to be one joing moving your hand palm, in training it will become two joints). Spiritually, indeed, we reach superhuman potentials. Over time, when you remove the stuck positions and movements, which are not smooth, you move less, with seemingly slower speed, to achieve more - for example, when turning, you turn directly and do not move things first backwards to overcome inertia, or you open door with your hand, not with legs or other hand pushing back.
