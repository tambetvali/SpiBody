# SpiBody — Introduction

SpiBody begins in the movements you already make: the way you stand when waiting, the way you reach for something, the way your weight shifts when you turn.  
Training here grows inside everyday actions until the whole body becomes more coordinated, more responsive, and more capable.  
You don’t need to prepare or understand everything in advance — you can start anywhere, and the body will meet you halfway.  
If you want a first sense of the landscape — the tone, the direction, the feeling — these three sites give you a broad view before you step into the deeper materials.  
They show how movement becomes clarity, how strength grows from softness, and how everyday actions become training.

# Rooted / Central

These are the six core texts of SpiBody.

---

## Holistic Body — Text 1

> ### **Whole‑Body Coordination & Natural Strength**  
> **Default version:** [🦴 Rooted/Central/holisticbody.md](Rooted/Central/holisticbody.md)  
> → A grounded, experiential description of whole-body training: how to sense the body as one piece, how to let movement flow through multiple layers, and how to build strength through coordination rather than strain.  
> - **AI version:** [🧠 Rooted/Central/holisticbodyai.md](Rooted/Central/holisticbodyai.md)  
>   → A compact, structured restatement of the same principles, highlighting steps and patterns for quick application.

This is the heart of SpiBody: how the whole body acts as one system, how movement distributes itself, and how strength appears when effort stops fighting itself.  
You’ll find descriptions of how to stand, how to move, how to let the body reorganize itself while you act — not through force, but through clarity and connection.  
The texts show how joints cooperate, how weight travels, how tension dissolves, and how new layers of movement appear over time.  
They also describe how everyday actions — opening a door, lifting a bag, walking across a room — can become training that builds structure, precision, and ease.  
If you want to understand the method through direct physical experience, this is where to begin.

## Health, Recovery & Collective Body — Text 2

> ### **Recovery Through Movement & Rebalancing**  
> **Default version (AI):** [💧 Rooted/Central/healthandrecoveryai.md](Rooted/Central/healthandrecoveryai.md)  
> → A step-by-step view of recovery as a physical process: how to support healing through movement, how to reduce unnecessary tension, and how to rebuild strength with minimal strain.  
> - **Original version:** [🌱 Rooted/Central/healthandrecovery.md](Rooted/Central/healthandrecovery.md)  
>  → A more intuitive, experiential look at how health grows from everyday actions, rest, and the body’s natural ability to reorganize itself.

> ### **Shared Fields & Collective Somatic Dynamics**  
> **Default version (AI):** [🔗 Rooted/Central/collectiveholisticbodyai.md](Rooted/Central/collectiveholisticbodyai.md)  
> → A structured exploration of collective somatic fields: how group dynamics shape movement, how shared rhythms emerge, and how training can extend beyond the individual.  
> - **Original version:** [🤝 Rooted/Central/collectiveholisticbody.md](Rooted/Central/collectiveholisticbody.md)  
>  → A more fluid, impression-based description of collective movement, written from lived experience and experimentation.

Training and recovery are not opposites here — they are two sides of the same process.  
These texts explore how the body repairs itself through movement, how tension unwinds, how breath and posture support regeneration, and how small adjustments can restore energy.  
They also describe how collective movement forms, how bodies influence each other, and how shared practice can amplify learning.  
Together, these four texts form the second major pillar of SpiBody.

# SpiBody - my essential goal

My essential goal:
- In name of spirituality, we follow the classics and authorities of Time
  - We have invented our own free mind, teachers who make us understand on decent level and not impose authority on concepts our parents did not see,
    but learnt.
- In name of exercise and sports, we do not gain this full intuition:
  - This is partially a Taoist material, which simplifies Taoist physical cognition and visualization into:
    - Simpler math
    - More tautological, axiomatic system
    - Once you understand, real Taoist methods of tradition *are* more powerful, but *not* easy to start from;
      - Simple example: Taoist has complex meridians and points;
        - My tautological method simplifies meridians into 6 directions - up down left right front back -,
          and mentions points as this: when you train hands, you can get flash pain in legs. This is point and connection.

          This is very complex to learn Qi Gong whole cycle, as well as to *prove exact force points*: rather we follow this *experience*
          of dot forces and pains which grow our body, and slow contemplation gives us something. To find out about acupuncture, find
          out which authors we trust and what is the scientific part - too much; but it needs noticing that those methods, often,
          train for real and far further than me. I made this training just for not breaking yourself.
    - My Taoist study: father's interest, some studies; later found something on my own, which searching - gave Taoist books.
  - This is partially a Buddhist guide, similar to Shaolin
    - Shaolin has complete, traditional method, which is outwards "dogmatic" for our spirituality.
    - We have open mind and study about body; to enter tradition, we need much more.
    - I have learnt Buddhism since early childhood with excitement and follow hard scientific buddhist branch.
  - This is partially a Viking guide for intuitions and freeform logic about movement and development of your body and spirit.
    - About this Viking method it's hard to say anything;
      - Basically it's kind of trivia that you can *feel* what your body needs and offers.
    - I am ancient Viking blood, more early than Sweden - altough smaller area of Baltic sea -, which later cooperated with Vikings.
      - Rather than just a war philosophy, I can introduce an old culture and tradition, which preceded Vikings in Baltic sea, in same
        traits, but unlike Vikings they remained rather local in early history. This historic Viking is not so specially "only" swedish,
        but Britains themselves, Germanies, Icelanders and many others are one or another branch of this older belief. It emphasizes you
        use physical force with belief.

# Freeform

You can enter anywhere: through a long central text, a short root, a note on balance, or a piece of music.  
The common thread is simple: use what you read to adjust how you move, how you stand, how you rest, how you act in ordinary situations.  
The growth here is physical first — in how your joints cooperate, how your weight travels, how tension appears and dissolves — and only then becomes clearer in thought.  
Take your time, explore at your own pace, and let the materials meet you where you are.
