# Training the body with Spiritual Perspective

I have not specifically studied yoga, but rather I study philosophies of martial arts and body cultures, and try to reach deep wisdom into intuition of this. This is compatible with our modern spirituality, which tries to reach essential truth rather than rely on authority.

# Holistic Perspective

"Holistic" is a view, by which you train the whole body, each part and each property of it - you can see lists of properties, such as bruce lee counts speed, flexibility and strenght among the properties of the body.

In this view, you do not try to count only on heavy training, but rather you train the body in it's completeness - adding just millimeters to flexibility of each part, and some to strength of it, would make it a lot more efficient. It's not so important to train only the parts, which are used to measure the strength against other bodies.

Fractal structure of body - you can move same part of the body by different muscles, for example the hand contains many muscles, which can move fingers, you can even do it with shoulder or your back. Also, then, if you train one part of your body completely, it fractally trains also each part of your body.

# Contemplation on body

You can use contemplative meditation, such as Zen or meditation of Buddha, to contemplate on your body, on it's internal and external organs.

With these sensations, you can use different groups of muscles, such as normal ones, fast muscles, muscles with electricity or other physical effect; you can also train the internal organs.

# Organs and muscles

You can train muscles and organs. Meditation on body parts creates sensation of these. It seems that to train organs, you can also use physical movement - you can feel your heart or organs grow. It seems that by training, you create sets of organs, such as ability to bread, in each part of your body.

You train the moving parts, but also the joints. You train brain / head, heart, organs, ass, genitals etc. You can see that it effects strenghtening chakras as you train areas around them.

# Avoid overexercize

Instead of using a lot of strength in your training on the same muscle group, it's better to find movements and positions, which are naturally hard. In each position of your hands, for example, you need to train the same positions of fingers again.

# Layers and Properties

You can see body builds up layers, and as you train joints in addition to moving parts, you also find that there are muscles connecting several parts of your body. Training your ass and genitals creates one of central forces, which allow you to walk perfectly.

Training some parts from lower to higher intelligence also creates sources for vitamins, abilities, etc.

# Magic of Training

Your body is able to show signs, such as marking some muscles as idiots or showing visual effects as you reach new capabilities. You need to travel this road with intuition.
