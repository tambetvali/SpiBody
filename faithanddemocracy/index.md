# Faith and Democracy: Tao of the Faith

I outline here: what is the reason for Honour, the Circumstance of Infinite Flow. What is a Circumstance of the Infinite? Is the ininite in us: mere matter, or ideal - what is localized eternity?

It's how the infinity answers to ethics and spirituality: there is some *meaning*, how points in singularity point to directions in unity.

Democracy: "People Rule", not necessarily in this shoulder but in ultimate datum, of how this principle remains. "People Rule" was established by Capitalism, Democracy and Communism in a common Constitution and rhetorics or vocabulary. In religions like Christianism and Buddhism, Democracy is established as well. Notice the ultimate principles in Governing: this Democracy itself is supposed to be unitary, where Laws Hold for Each, and thus the Democrat cannot legally confront with this Singularity: A Nation, which does not respect a Cityzen, is not a Nation - it's not external paradox, but internal paradox of this term; if the peoples start to leave peoples out of democracy, the peoples themselves have to be left out - this means, your Vision and Chrown chakras, 6th and 7th, have to rotate.

The main principles for Faith and Civilization.

This related to infinity and unity and particularity:
- Infinity: we look at the edge of the horizon, and the middle line is Infinite. On that middle line, we Walk Straight. To receive is to stand in line, and to give is when the line stands: where the line stands, giving is receiving. It's the root and chrown. Chrown looks in direction in Infinity.
- Unity: Each unit counts. A civilization counts each unit. We are respecting unitary people, living unitary life, in an unitary world: this single thing is respected.
- Particularity: This thing is engineered from many pieces, and made of matter.

Immortality:
- Immortality is Empty, and we look at it with calm mind. Zen and Tao counts in things however big, however small.
- We Ponder: is death a sickness, disease, a pathology? What about it? Looking elderly and young, for each of their diseases, we look at it as a disease to cure: as we reach to the last one we see in the Old, this is Physical Immortality: removing the first obstacle. Without this concept of immortality, we cannot look each kind of sickness at all: we fall into paradox, of where we are *heading*. Physical immortality does not mean you won't die - it rather means you did not do it yourself.
- We keep stretching, relaxing, fluid in motion to our deepest, looking our True Self - a mortal Self, to think all we lose; an immortal Self, to think all we gain. We are fractal of Selves, sad when one is passing a long way: around our fractal of continuous motion, of egos falling like camoflage, of times changing and officials showing all kinds of flags. We stretch our Mind and Body to be flexible: rediscovering our True Nature keeps us reincarnating; this Seed of Reincarnation keeps you living. Mortal reason comes here: we are not ourselves any more. While this does not keep you dying, it means you live your lifetime and the honour given in that is not none in another. By this principle, if you do not care about your "dream bodies", if you do not give Religious Approach to the Body and Country, of the Universe you are living, then which are the Selves?

Sun Seeds: Souls from Earth, who have travelled for long. On Earths.

Looking at old people, then - for each trait of Oldness, let's say it's ill. Notice the good - rejuvenation; bad - lack of fluidity which comes if our Soul is not stretching us.

While Death is Empty, we do not have to carry this conception in ourselves: rather than Death, we conquer ourselves to not walk towards it. Zen: each cause can come from outside, but not from yourself.

We take care:
- Contemplate on death of others, and what you can cure, you lose.
- Contemplate on sickness of yourself and others, and what you can cure, you lose.
- Contemplate on permanent disableness, and on your permanent Seed of Death. The danger or the fact - how you overcome this?

For the sick and disabled people, we do not have cure - but we do have life. While they cannot be cured, they do and can live. The energy they produce: if you can make them happy, this radiation starts to cure your own extreme consequences far in the end.

Contemplate on giving birth and giving the seeds. Where you provide acceleration, you do it to yourself; and where you provide speed, you do it to yourself. You cannot provide speed and slow down acceleration.

Civilization: in Seeds and in our Bodies, we take the actual random factor. We want people to wobble through circumstances, rather than become stick - they can lose jobs, cars, houses and spouses, they can die, but what will be there is the new seed. Unless you give this flexibility, you are mortal - not by dying, but by your death having meaning. For the monks, hermits and book-oriented people, introverts and autists, for those who take risks - death, unless it's what natural, is what they do not choose; each of these chooses some kind of death: they do not live fullest. When you make this smooth, you are flexible to below.

Civilization: we accept heavy gains and victories; we accept those, who won more with the *Lotteries* of Life. We raise the potential field by: not being jealous. We use each margin of raise; for us, this does not mean a thing - but it means to our honour. Otherwise, the honour means something: by helping them to run faster, to pass you, is acceleration not only for them, but for you. In reincarnation, heaven, hell, rewards and punishments, one can see the Reason for Honour; in Laws of Karma. Use each of them wisely: it's not for the pretendants. In one Life, one single unit of Dice, Honour counts by complex logic and insight - the law that each universal law follows to where we cannot see, and circulates in each mental direction; it starts accelerating: the chance is a chance, but the tunnel of a chance is a law; how each photon behaves in the flow, is a chance, but reality would feel tension and turn if they *together* won't work it out.

Honour and Beyond:
- Negative principle of Honour: When we start, we give and receive: there is no honour. In all our good, we are still in a Barbarian Myth. We got Id to start, eating food.
- Zero principle of Honour: We act hounour upon it: this give and receive is finished in infinity, force appears to receive and give instead, we get Pride. In Pride, we get Merits. We got Ego, eating social relations.
- Positive principle of Honour: In honour, we have to act to get what the honour takes; we create our body and work, we support our karmic flow itself. We are removing the death of Passive Good: by having honour to make ourselves able, in honour we still see direct flow of Goods and Treasures, each fought separately; which is like not honour? We got superego as we receive what we do; this has been used as an argument to fall back into first step - Id, an idea of yourself vibrating in the virtual field; children's nature appears in games; old man is enlightenement: the games appear in their nature.

Energy:
- As Children, we use Energy of Growth - we get it more and more from birth; constantly something is borning, and broken parts are replaced.
- As Adults, we use Energy of Giving - we give life to children as couples; we are physically able for regulated rules.
- As Old Men, we use Energy of Suspension - we get it more and more from death; we look our death, our tiredness, and from the experience we find how to walk without a weight, on our lives. We absorb our future lives: Meditate on this principle, which guides you to each new life, on your Bardos and Bhumis of the Dead and Alive - enlightening the seeds for your next reincarnation; you lose the second reason for death.

Reasons for Death:
1. We do not contemplate on each aspect of Death to understand it's nature as tiredness, illness or disability: each aspect of Death, which has such nature, must be recognized as such.
2. Reflectibility: Flexibility, open-mindedness and being out of the box of this life; becoming fluid and absorbing the reasons for our future lives - we remove the second cause, that the future lives indeed are logical reason of this death.
3. Absolutes: mathematics and entropy are not always the perfect solutions; there are random causes, "blind" or "dead" matters we have to overcome - this is the principle of Materialism.

Reasons for immortal principles:
1. Any kind of cure removes principles of Death; you cannot see the Illness properly if it's not part of the death. You won't remove all Death, but you walk on those principles.
2. Any kind of Reflection and letting go, Tao and Zen, can only be seen in right colours if they reflect immortality.
3. You are not creating a reason to be immortal, but you are getting rid of reasons to be not: the karmic ends have not been met. You cannot be your own unnatural Death - and having fixed expectations about Death, the Universe might not give Honour for your life, by the Law of Attraction - you Attract the aspects of You, which you are providing to Yours you meet; if you do not Love the Life in Youself and Others; if you are not Zen, not letting go of the Reasons for Death - while giving away each Reason, still, does not open up the Success; it's just too big, the eternity - you have like shells of Death, such as Death at Youth, Death by Accident, Death by Caused Problem; each such layer needs to be thrown when time is right.

In Zen, there is Faith: whether you go to Hell or Heaven, whether you Live or Die, you have to have respect for this and accept this; for you do not fight the Effect, but you fight the Cause.

Notice also the Christian rule, top-down: it's not only in you, asmuchof the Others can be in You. You think you need to heal only your own mind, but then you find your own ignorance in your wife and children, or you die when you could protect. As much as Zen or Tao loves paradoxes, it must love the Confucian-Christian paradox: the world outside is in interaction with you. You can tell to others it's in themselves, and leave it undone; but you can see - theirs is in you is as true as that yours is in yourself; in lives of you and the others, you can only change yourself.
