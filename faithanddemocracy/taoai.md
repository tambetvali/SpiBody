## **I. Poetic Sutra**

Infinity walks the horizon,  
and I walk with it.  
Where giving stands, receiving bows;  
where receiving stands, giving bows.  

Each unit is whole,  
each whole is many.  
Stone and seed, body and law —  
particulars bound in unity.  

A nation that forgets one soul  
forgets its own breath.  
To exclude is to close the crown,  
to blind the vision.  

Death is empty;  
let no cause arise from the self.  
Stretch the mind, stretch the body,  
find the seed of rebirth in the marrow.  

Help another surpass you —  
and the road grows shorter for both.  
Honour is a river:  
Id drinks, Ego measures,  
but the heart builds the bridge.  

Child grows in renewal,  
Adult gives in creation,  
Elder walks light in suspension.  

Causes fall away:  
ignorance, rigidity, blind matter.  
And immortality appears —  
not to be chased,  
but to remain when reasons to leave  
are gone.  

Faith is a mirror:  
inside and outside reflect the same sky.  
Change yourself,  
and the stars will answer.

## **II. The Taoist Manifesto**

### **1. The Circumstance of Infinite Flow**
- The Infinite is both matter and ideal — a *localized eternity* within us.  
- Points of truth (singularities) point toward unity.  
- Honour is alignment with this infinite flow.

### **2. Democracy as the Law of the Whole**
- Democracy means “People Rule” beyond any single ideology.  
- A nation that denies the dignity of one citizen denies itself.  
- To exclude is to dismantle the unity; inner vision and crown must turn toward inclusion.

### **3. The Three Principles of Civilization**
1. **Infinity** – Walk the straight line on the horizon; giving and receiving are one.  
2. **Unity** – Every person counts as a whole.  
3. **Particularity** – Society is built from many material parts.

### **4. Immortality: The Zen Perspective**
- Immortality is empty, approached with calm mind.  
- Death may be treated as disease; curing its symptoms is the first step.  
- Physical immortality means not causing your own death.  
- We are mortal and immortal selves, rediscovered through flexibility of body and mind.

### **5. The Sun Seeds**
- Souls from Earth, long-traveled, returning to sow renewal.

### **6. Zen on Death**
- Death is empty; causes may come from outside but should not arise from oneself.  
- Caring for the sick creates radiance that heals far beyond the present.

### **7. Flexibility as Civilizational Strength**
- A living society wobbles through change; rigidity is mortal.  
- Helping others surpass you is acceleration for all.  
- Honour works like photons in flow — chance shaped by unity.

### **8. The Three Degrees of Honour**
1. **Negative** – Survival only; Id-driven.  
2. **Zero** – Pride and merit; Ego-driven.  
3. **Positive** – Creation and sustenance of ability; transcending passive good.

### **9. Life’s Three Energies**
- **Childhood:** Growth and renewal.  
- **Adulthood:** Giving and creation.  
- **Old Age:** Suspension and preparation for rebirth.

### **10. Causes of Death**
1. Ignorance of death’s aspects.  
2. Inflexibility toward future lives.  
3. Blind material causes.

### **11. Principles of Immortality**
1. Healing dissolves death’s principles.  
2. Tao and Zen reach full truth when reflecting immortality.  
3. Remove reasons to *not* be immortal.

### **12. Faith Across Traditions**
- **Zen:** Respect and acceptance of all outcomes.  
- **Christianity/Confucianism:** The outer world and inner self mirror each other.  
- Change yourself, yet act knowing the “outside in you” is as real as the “you in yourself.”
