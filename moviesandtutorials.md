# Movies and tutorials

Internet contains many movies and cinematic tutorials.

I am becoming more sensory and I do not want to process intellectually; for most you see, I watch the pictures and animations very carefully.

Youtube and other channels let you watch and download free videos. This guide is for you to search: to reflect the changing structure of what is freely available, and authors ease to take their creative work back at will, I will describe you the Search process - you will find what you need.

## Some movies

**Medieval Music with Female Vocals in Old English – A Journey Through Time**: she sounds like Viking sometimes, and let's you to be calm and meditative without being slow-paced mind. The simplicity, which looks a little childish in some parts, where we have more complex sequences from classics: you can know the basics and perhaps, they had muscle to move that simple without loss of intent.

**The Legend of Bodhidharma： Master of Zen ｜ Mind-Opening Movie [Eng Dub⧸2025 Remaster]**: the scene is chinese symbolic martial art, where each movement refines one essence of Zen: in wuxia, the movement reflects the symbolic changes and might relate to beliefs about saints. For us the mundanes the inspiration would draw into what is an ideal of that movement, where we could develop many possible sequences; while this movie has also an enigma, one which does not solve completely, but provides the physical basis of solution - where one can contemplate about difference between religion and superstition, perhaps.

**A Breath of Release | Somatic Meditation | Guided #Breathwork Meditation**

## Length of a movie

Tutorials (text analog: manutal, tutorial, article-format useful piece of information):
- They are 10 minutes long and range from 1 to 25 minutes, where each such case has exceptions.
- Tutorials introduce to large theoretic materials or explicly guide through specific processes of practice.
- Whether it's visually compelling or a person is talking to you, most generally you can spend 5 minutes without sensory underload.
- Good format:
  - For such a short time, often any format would do.

Tutorial might be 1 minute introduction to a general topic, or 5 minutes for one practical idea.

Essentials (text analog: essay, 40-60 page book):
- They are 30 minutes long and range from 5 minutes to 25 minutes.
- Essentials cover one topic in such way that with some intelligence, you can understand it practically.
- To have 30 minutes of sensory stimulation, one needs fluid and complex video with special effects.
- Good formats:
  - Slides, talk and text running under the slides would create special emotion or experience for 30 minutes.
  - Visually loaded sequences of information are not getting you tired, but provide a load of information, which does not ruin your exercise.

Essentials, generally, cover a wide topic in short time and you can use them as an introduction for a course: without most general terms, you would not understand a course.

Other type of essentials typical for spiritual video has number of points, such as 3, 5 or 8 traits of one thing: like buddha has such lists, which are essentially centric to life, like 4 laws to understand dukkha, 8 good habits etc.

Other type gives you overview of certain degree of certain school, what example what are the capabilities of 33rd degree freemason; or which goal would destiny you to the path of Shaolin monk.

Courses  (text analog: 200-350 page book for 1 hour, 400-600 page book for 2 hours, 1200-3600 page book for six to eight hours or insane formats, like four volumes of encyclopedic or deep scientific materials, which is equivalent to taking a whole course in real university, but might not be less effort - analugously, you can often get exams and certificates from providers of courses):
- Different types of courses are for 1 hour (introduction), 2 hours (movie length), 8 hours (a working day) or 1-3 24h days. Each of these formats spans some area, for example movie length courses can be from 1.5 to 2.5 hours and typically you are already able to do something with that information after the course. 3 day course, necessarily, needs to be divided into parts and I have never finished any - this needs particular planning of time and resources and is not completely "free". 8 or 10 hour course fits saturday or sunday very well, but gets your tired. It's often good idea to watch shorter, then longer and longer formats of associated topics: it's a fractal.
- Very often, universities, online universities and free universities offer courses.
- Good formats
  - Just a professor speaking might be boring, while you can watch series of lectures in one month (which is a little different type). On contrary, you do not catch long time of very fast clips.
  - You want extensive audiovisual information with good voice and subtitles - if you are not able to utilize all your senses and intellectual capabilities, this might feel like a loss of time.
  - 8 hour course can even get you introduced to quantum physics, chemistry or a conceptual basis of the whole religion.

## Movie search

"Enlightenment", "Kundalini", "Kundalini awakening", "Reincarnation", "Deep Night of the Soul":
- You can develop quite small set of such terms to get a very general distribution of religious terms.
- You find 1-5 minute intros, 30-45 minute overviews, 1.5-3h movies very typically. To look for longer materials, some are quite perfect.

"Taoist documentaries", or Taoist movies about certain topics: Taoists, often, manage to provide you with 30min to 1.5 min movies, many of those of high quality.

To find movies:
- Write keywords in youtube search, or search in google and click "videos": there might also be downloaders available in case you are mostly offline or want a very high quality (you might need to consult licences to understand, whether you can also share such material).
- ChatGPT and CoPilot, or any GPTish chat would be able to give you free videos or movies of certain topics: you can describe, what you want to find inside, for example "Taoist materials of body-mind union with exercises, visual materials, anatomic explanations; other eastern schools like Shaolin would do; free downloads" - in offline mode, those robots might give you outdated videos, removed materials or even they might think out a more or less realistic name for a movie; with internet search enabled, you might get good materials after explaining more deeply and essentially than the search keywords are.

## Amounts of information

The world is very small: not many people provide quality information about the same topic; typically each person tries to provide you with unique qualities or missing topics. In realm of spiritual videos, it's currently like a city life: you find small number of quality materials about each topic, but this quality is generally very high.

For your most practical needs, 10-30 minutes of overview or introduction to "axiomatic set", such as the natural laws from Kybalion: this is a good overload of senses for several days. Consider that fiction movies of 1.5-2 hours require very similar effort as unique story does not need individuation of your capabilities, but you are able to order it well in your understanding and memory. Yet, you need abstract information: for abstract information, 8-10 hour session will get you deep into one topic (compare: this is around 12 sessions of 45 minutes, or 6 sessions of 1.5 hours: if you have class in each week or two in university, apart from exams and first-day introductions; in school, one and half months of a course is able to cover one topic - this is common in Steiner schools).

From 8-10 hours you have a general framework, so that you look a scientific body in a balanced way, also you know many basic particulars of local complexities. This enables you to search manuals intelligently: inside an activity you generally read a manual or tutorial or watch 5 minutes of a manual or tutorial - you can also watch every 30 seconds of this tutorial with doing this thing immediately.

## Limitations of audiovisual information

If you consider all your purposes into one 8 hour material, currently it's very hard: if it's visual, it is not very throughout and detailed; if it's a real university course, it's still only a professor talking and sketching to screen; if it's full of actual activities, you might get sensory overload: you are actually not able to study all this material.

For shorter courses, you can watch parts of them several times, slow them down and check later. For long courses, it's design must fit your cognitive abilities and motor reflection abilities very well to be useful: otherwise, you get very bored or cannot follow it. A few formats suit different people, who might look for different kinds of information inside: for example, it's visually very explanative narrative, but you need careful watching with sharp attention to find much more also correct conceptions inside.

An opposite order of watching: after watching the 8-hour full course, where you can have 2 months of 1 hour academic lessons in one day, you can find similar 2-hour courses, perhaps even from the same university; those are not only good introductions, but also suit well to repeat and refresh your memory.

## Limitations of you

Notice for long course, watching more than 3 or 4 for one year is very hard: the process in your mind is complicated and much longer than the course, and physically you might run one maraton for each course - before you recover from the maraton, you feel also too tired to watch another course.

One or two one or two hour movies per month, and daily ingestion of several additional materials from 30 seconds to 20 minutes would fill you with information: you always have something to do.

To have considerably more than this - is already a research.

Notice for more "free time" or entertainment types of materials, watching one part every day, even several series in parallel, is much more easy and more common: while I have my movie-periods, watching a movie each day for 3 months, I generally do not watch TV and analougously do not spend my time on fictional series, rather I watch serious fiction of rare quality, much like two movies given herein.
