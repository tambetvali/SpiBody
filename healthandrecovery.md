# Health and recovery

For long-term training, I have seen the following development:
- My back pain, which I got as a children spending a day for getting rid of young trees in a building place of the garden, has seemed to recover into a muscle some 30 years later, at age 43. The part in pain needs to be exercised to recover faster - it could remain in pain for years, where only one strong movement is needed to recover it, a moment of energy spent.
- My ears had chronic pain at winters, also lasting more than 30 years - training of hands and head created, suddenly, much better muscular system in the area of pain, and I got rid of this in sense that open window does not ruin my day any more. I don't know whether it's muscle or organ, but movement of this and the connected parts of the body can be physical and remove the pain.
- My headaches, also more or less chronic, also seemed to fade away with training of the internal and external muscles of the brain, which got more air and cleanness as well - making me a better physical thinker (and developing V-shaped muscular connection to my body so that the head is actually muscle-connected with the body). I don't know how much muscles we need for metaphysical thoughts, and perhaps our minds think as we are dead, but for physical system we can see the muscles in some movie of conquering a dangerous planet of dinosaurs - the actors, generally, have some thesis of physical brain for fast and complicated movements.
- My legs, in some position, for many years, got a pain, which I could not explain and associated with cold. Here as well, exercise was helpful: keeping the pain and meditating on this area, as well as creating additional muscle tension in the pained parts - instead of releasing the pain by creating an opposite position for a moment - developed a muscle out of this thing, which seemed more as a flesh in pain; I think it was a muscle with development time of many years; indeed the development speed is such that we get muscles as we are adults, and some parts of the brain in the normal life get more intense as we get 70.
- I could not recover the teeth, which are broken - I only want natural cure -; the cure, instead of surgery and fake organs, which I avoid (but which could be added to such cure in case the implants do not disturb the muscles): certain exercises of fingers and brain of the hand - which generated witamin organs and big systems in body, in the fractal development, where the lack of them could block a whole muscular system or it's ability or skill, a fresh feeling - developed better muscular system for my teeth, and seemed to develop virtual teeth associated with their fractal counterparts to become stronger (it's shown that we do feel the removed organs in virtual way, but it's also efficient to train them in fractal body recovery); I also learned to move the teeth or what is left of them - there are muscles, which directly move the teeth. I did not recover from the pain, but these are examples of things, including training the areas which compassionate with the teeth pain; I got the general thesis of the medicine: teeth in bigger body, indeed, have more localized pain and instead of ruining the days they become rather small hard-to-notice organs; I think I got the teeth into positive sign again, where I had some repeated pain, non-localized to whole body and creating effects, such as pain on walking or headache and inability to think, in repeated cycles of 2-3 days. Meditation helped to get over each instance, but the permanent and strong effect is not trivial with only meditation: especially once you understand the pain and get a philosophy of slow, steady recovery (the mentality to just get it stronger, instead of looking for final solutions, which are idealistic in case of teeth, if not impossible for most of the conditions - growth of the holistic strength of each necessary part should not follow a destination, but the path); the physical training, indeed, creates lasting changes in the teeth and all their connections to body.

Each case we train a muscle, we also get some pain / tension in other parts of the body - we can also stretch or tense this part, and sometimes we can use indirect exercises to train parts, which are not so easy to directly associate with some movement: for example, in case of teeth, I am not so excited of moving them directly, I rather just prove the thesis, but I like the associations where exercises of hands, fingers and other parts of the body have development cycles, where they directly strenghten the teeth. Pain of the teeth is not local to a single tooth, but generally they have connected points, which tend to pain all together - they have a whole structure of pain in the body, and studying and exercising all this, as well as intuitively finding more, will help to revitalize the general life and life skills again into positive nivel of energy, which could save the whole day.
