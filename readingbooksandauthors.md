# Further reading

I am a Buddhist, thus the books given here are mostly Buddhist, Taoist and Confucionist books. The relation with my texts is direct or indirect, as you might need a background in several things to start.

As everything here around, the books are more or less free and readily available from sources such as Internet Archive in various formats - pdf, epub or txt.

## Taoist books on body and mind

#### __Cultivating Stillness__: __a Taoist manual for transforming body and mind__ (_Eva Wong_)

185 page book, which is clear to read book by Eva Wong. In high school she became excited of Tao-te Ching (Lao-tzu) and Chuang-tzu, two classics of extreme value. Later, she could get out of the magic of these books and the comments and find out about the vastness of the Taoist canon.

"Stillness" is a basis of Taoist and Confucian meditation, as mentioned in the books; as a comparison, stillness is also a basis of Buddhist meditation, such as Zen, Mindfulness or Buddha's initial meditation.

##### The Book of Chuang Tzu

This book as well as daodejing are well available free from internet, to understand Eva Wong.

#### __Cosmic Healing I__ (_Mantak Chia_)

The book warns you to not do the practices without proper community especially in case you have mental problems. This is scientific and spiritual author, which has strong connection to east and west.

It contains physical exercises, conceptions and relations, which help you to strenghten your physical and mental makeup, with anatomy of your body and it's brains, and relates this to spiritual structure of your body - one you could meet as you become conscious of it's sensations, and the language the body uses to meet you, and you use to meet the body; indeed, the centers of brain rather show you buttons and screens you can practically use, where the spiritual aspect of the world makes sense and relates much to the meanings of physical things. Eventually, each dimension you can find in mathematics is real, but we can question the degree of the simplifications and modelling versus actual spiritual reality - rather than asking what is "real", for each model is real if it explains the world or the experience of it, so rather separate between the material, logical and symbolic visions, and find pleasure in the coherence of each of them - it does not affect your life so much what is the "essence", or as scientists say: while we know a lot about electrons, we do not know their essence; the matter, rather, is empty and void, and we should have pleasure and work for it as a life, mysterious and unexplainable even at the end of the science, unless there is any deeper source of the information.

#### __The Tao of health, longevity, and immortality__: __The Teachings of Immortals Chung and Lii__ (_TRANSLATED By Eva Wong_)

You can find out some natural rhythyms and great ideas: for example the meaning of each phase in your life.

#### __Qigong Meditation__: __Embryonic Breathing__ (_Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming_)

Breathe like a child. Breathing is a central concept in the exercise of the East.

#### __Taoist Yoga__: __Alchemy and Immortality__ (_Lu K'uan YÃ¼ (Charles Luk)_)

Well if you live longer, either physically, spiritually or in this way the Taoist can not explain you - perhaps we could meet in infinity of time, in one way or another ;) As a Buddhist, I mention that give deep thought about the achievements of just connecting your lifetimes into a stream, and from Zen, you cannot achieve this consciousness unless you are able to let go of your whole existence unless the Nature would not suffer from it; once you let go, you can concentrate on this with calm mind: perhaps you won't become immortal, perhaps you just connect with the future generations or the future yourselves - whatever it is, while we might doubt in reaching the end of the way, it's hard to doubt in these exercises and conceptions.

__Tao & Longevity__: __An originol discussion obout meditation
ond the cultivotion of Tao__
(_Transloted by Wen Kuan Chu, Ph.D_, _From the original Chinese by
Huai-Chin Nan_, _Edited by Koren Allen, Ph.D._)

Okay the book has as long history as you could have ;)

## Hindu Books

#### __Siddhas__: __Masters of the Basics__ (_Pal Pandian_)

Well it's the deep wisdom and poetry, which might lead you to "Indological Truths".

## Buddhist Books

#### __Tao of Jeet Kune Do__ (_Bruce Lee_)

I think he was a Buddhist, mostover: the first part of the book is deep philosophy you should read; the second part is exercises developed from many schools of martial arts - I personally have not worked for this, but you can see he emphasised so many good principles to get healthy.

## Anatomy

#### __The Body Atlas__: __A Pictorial Guide to the Human Body__ (_illustrated by Guiliano Fornari_)

66 page book of the human body - as it's really hard to get through the next one without using it as a reference.

#### __Anatomy & Physiology__ (_OpenStax_)

This is 1984 page encyclopedia of human anatomy. It starts from introduction to human body, followed by chemical, cellular, tissue and organic levels of it's organization.

## From Shamanism to Magic and Alchemy

#### __Tao Magic__ (_Laslo Legeza_)

This is the shamanism of the China.

#### __The book of the magi__ (_Francis Barrett_)

This is a very throughout book of the Western Magic, called "philosophy" and thus as speculative and philosophical as it can be - "speculative" means it should not be very resistent to convince you with belief, but rather tries to build it up on intuitive logic as much as possible with such complex topic involving myriad things in life, such as creating a medicament from a reptile (Hippocrates), which is rather "symbolic".

__Foundations of Internal Alchemy__: __The Taoist Practice of Neidan__ (_Wang Wu_)

This is a transformation from our initial states into the Emptiness, 132 pages.

#### __The Philosophy of Natural Magic__ by _Henry Cornelius Agrippa con Nettesheim_

This is the long story of Western Magic.

295 pages. For example, chapter 64 is "CHAPTER 64. HOW THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND CHANGE THE BODY BY WAY OF IMITATION FROM SOME RESEMBLANCE; OF THE TRANSFORMING AND TRANSLATING OF MEN, AND WHAT FORCE THE IMAGINATIVE POWER HATH, NOT ONLY OVER THE BODY BUT THE SOUL" - you could see why it's contained here.

## Analogy of Human

#### __Being There__:
__Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again__ (_Andy Clark_)

This is a book about robots - if you want to understand human mind and body from it's basic principles, perhaps you want to meet the interesting practices of creating similar machines; by what is a problem, solution or optimization for the machine, might explain also the reasons and consequences evolution and God would meet when creating a human. Many things we see as emotional and complex could easily arrive from much more basic logic and become relevant in anything which wants to move, be efficient and think on some level. We are optimized sometimes on similar level.

The human as living organism with soul is indeed different, but we share many physical obstacles and solutions and limits or possibilities, structures of logic and mechanics - developing my body, I can see it as a masterpiece of engineering, and younger, concentrating on mind - I could see many things, which seem psychological, are actually practical outcomes for any calculating machine, such as our nerves could be seen by certain paradigm. You could fall in traps God felt in the beginning - does the machine design suddenly repeat some historic event, such as extinction of the "dinosaur" with large body mass and small brains?

## Vikings

__Introduction to Nordic
Cultures__ (_Edited by Annika Lindskog and Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen_)

You could find about Viking Magic, which more often than not includes physical makeup for containing the Spirit, runes and poetry.

Vikings rather do not _believe_, which means that their approach is practical: while one might not speculate about God, angels or materialist laws, one does what is appropriate when they meet different people, and shares, of the experience, mostly the things they could understand; the actual spellcraft and sorcery of Vikings - in many cases one, rather than believing in the effects, in my experience, just enjoys the message, sound and feeling of the spell, continuing their practical existence rather than expecting any radical outcomes; when one can see spellcraft as magic to influence the nature, one can take the Viking approach I can see: be open about the world, and notice the people, be skeptic like an atheist, still enjoy the shamanic experience and notice what is going on, still get the christian feeling in it's church - understand the towers towards sky, stone walls and people with prayers from heart, the moment could enlight a Viking for they have no belief about what is going on - they just see the people helped, the bread shared, and the energetic feeling of it.

Viking should have a magical body, just as a Siberian: we do not believe much in sense of belief or "breaking the natural laws", rather it's a good style and natural flow, essential to human being, which associates it with symbols and proper feelings of movement of the body, bringing it to natural flows and effects; by going through Shamanism, Alchemy, Religion and Materialism, each is strenghtening the human nature by the experience, while none of them deserves heavy protection for a specific thing.

In this book, the Viking attitude is described in Swedish example, which is deeply rooted in freedom of mind, and coexistence of different nations, religions and beliefs with careful scientific observation, which rather informs than fights with anything - if you are a believer in religion, it makes any sense to criticise other religions, but as a Viking, you find forests and nature, perhaps some spirits or feelings they would produce, you find towers, people eating properly and creating unification - you could see them having different sizes, different materials, different ways to develop and colors, but you still meet many things you could understand, such as relating the tower to the sky; indeed, in the tower, to get an association of things high above as is natural and evident for a Viking. This experience shapes us.

## Fighting philosophy

As we face the suffering, we fight less and form the "win-win" scenarios among us as we give some thought for the fight; Buddhist and especially eastern philosophies suggest that as the life brings us battles - not only with humans, but with deep forces -, we should heal our conflicting minds into something more constructive; the victory is deeply rooted inside ourselves - but we should be successful over people, who want to break them. As you meet people, who are concerned about your victories, you need to raise over this - with more strength and expression you build up a constitution, which make you more and more calm about the commoners.

#### __Budo__: __Teachings of the Founder of Aikido__ (_Morihei Ueshiba_)

It says: _BudÅ is a divine path established by the gods that leads to truth, goodness, and beauty; it is a
spiritual path reflecting the unlimited, absolute nature of the universe and the ultimate grand design
of creation_.

I think you could understand Japanese when reading this book, and it could remove clouds from your mind of protection and survival - well I am more interested in the philosophy than the positions at the rest of the book.

##### __The Book of Five Rings__ (_Miyamoto Musashi_)

This is a great book for a strategy.

## Adventure

#### The Land of Fire: A Tale of Adventure (_Mayne Reid_)

Well if you forget about the great virtues of adventurous mind! For a buddhist path, especially Kundalini: many find the _adventure_ psychologically hard, for example you have to go through "Deep Night of the Soul" with rather Buddhist calm or an adventurous feeling, not so much with avoidance of the pain in your soul: in so many cases, the enlightenment might pass away.

## Love

The last, but not the least:

#### __Taoist Secrets of Love__: __Cultivating Male Sexual Energy__ (_Mantak & Maneewan Chia_)

The man and the woman are born to be one. The most powerful sexual force is letting go, and the next one is still being one: positive rewards from the girls, the inspiring attitudes, a man and a woman creating a song together..
