# The Book

Easy introduction: **Safely Connect with your Body Somatic Meditation ÔΩú Mindful Movement** (a video)

It's a free book, like most of books here: I try to find free and licenced books, and if their status would change, we would need to find books with similar coverage and topics as those are essential here.

The Awakening Body
Somatic Meditation for
Discovering our Deepest Life

Reginald A. Ray

Shambhala * Boulder 2016

This seems to be principially free press in regards to countably many of the items I've seen - an effort to provide several important basis for free.

It's hard to find where Buddhist normally mentions meditating on Body - in this book, yes.

We are practicants interested in the practice: specifically let's look at "Practice One: Ten Points" to compare with my personal meditation and to find out, whether this practice is to be researched as my Traditional Reference or Proof / Approval.

I was child when I started to meditate on my body. At age 17 this was my developed model. Later, I confirmed Body as something suggested by Buddha. Naturally, I used each Buddhist meditation fact or rule, assimilating this to my Body Awareness Meditation. When I used to be meditating on Material Body from 17 to 40, starting from 30 to now - 43 - I am meditating biological body: not simple spatial coordinates, but it's actual functions and situations in how it is engineered and works; this is now a more symbolic language and development of sensation - the meanings of our senses, until they blend sharply into resolved, conscious reality or higher senses: holistic vision, where our senses and mind, brain or intellect and creativity work together and provide one hologram for meaningful senses and meaningful intent: this is a reason behind magic and spirituality.

Body Scan is also defined as such as easily available in search and some descritpions. It does not have many visible materials to learn it, so it's probably rather a secret, patented method - by it's description, I think people might have been inspired by it to find similar methods, methods which contain the advice from it's public description, that it's growth to scan body with mind. It sounds very much like a very technical method rather than spiritual, and it's definitely not an open science as no bot nor google search has given me the precise method and precise philosophy, so it cannot be part of Buddhist teachings or it's extended canon, but only for some selected few.

Points 1-7 (the practice section at page 41) of Ten Points starting from page 38 are the actual points I have described as my meditation for body awareness, of body as target of Buddhist meditation as Buddha taught it: even if he was not, in it's most popular work and derivations, very specific about this particular aspect.

Page 54 - "The Practice", under "Practice Two: Earth Descent". The first paragraph is definitely very good description of my own healing method, which is natural and follows from such meditation naturally, as well as aligning with common traditions of healing with mind or spirit in our space. In the book it's methodologically described, so that the reason, as well as the actual method and it's purpose (as reason) can be actually seen.

The first practice can be seen as central - from awareness of your space, you learn to survive there. Book contains important selection of practices, six out of twenty-five: again, let's presume these six are balanced to also meet, more generally, the purpose of 25. Take this as a fractal.

So here I can confirm my own path with established tradition.

Notice that I no way guarantee that you are on particular Taoist path, following my work:
- While greatly inspired by Buddha and other Teachers, I am inspired by spiritual people of our generations, long traditions, work to modernize the traditions, and myself. Basically what I represent is my unique, personal method - while I am deep to find the common thing, I am not so apt to give you it's most common, dictionary-like representations, where you need to follow all the references and sources.

By reading this book, indeed you understand my method of meditation, but notice:
- I describe mine in 4 steps, each step having 1-2 points, so it's like 4 full lines of text. It's better to understand if you know Zen.
- My methods are like Zen, and original meditation of Buddha by principles he has described and which are mostly best known, and it involves my experience and creativity, and work on modern science and other religions - I use each source, internal external and the growth and experience of me.
- Taoism heavily relies on Visualization, but my method nor this Buddhist method rely on visualization, creation of artificial images to memorize the body and connect closer to it's actual structures: while both methods work with specific training, my method and the method in this book are relied on objective observation of sensations actually present, and are similar to "neutral observation", even "whatever happens", by Buddha: these 4 words are best to describe method of Buddha: to sit and observe the mind, whatever happens. Now what we actually do: to sit and observe the *body*, whatever happens. In Buddhism it relates: when talking mostly about mind, mind (emotions, thoughts etc.) and body exist in the same list of eight points of focus of meditation - naturally, this much given we assue we have to use *the same method*, but *on another aspect*.

What happens with this Body Somatic meditation? Passing this raise of awareness, while it's Mind over the Body: it's a very strong instrument to *watch*, but not at all so strong to *move*. We can see how body gets tired, and how it's principle is to move: we can see that we are too weak to do each exercise so heavily, so long time, to become supermen at first place. While, later, we might become supermen: we do not try to use all our force for 10 repetitions of our exercise, but like Tai Chi and Qi Gong, we need to do steady, stable movements, rhythyms and patterns, and get closer to more extend, strength, speed, ease, and periods of time and the fractals of it. Instead of using any battery or energy in it's fullest, to get tired in 30 seconds: we see this as fractal of death, where you live intensely at youth, and then get old and die. We try to do stable, firm exercise, in holistic way: in the range of movements and in unity of time, where we can end one exercise and start another, our strength does not end: life does not make us tired in this fractal. Our strength indeed grows and we can still do many things more strongly over time - yet, I suggest to do them even more effortlessly. Middle Way is not extreme middle - indeed, you cultivate some superpowers, and with stable growth things you saw as taking much of your battery, will take less.

Perhaps, your life in general will take less batteries - and you live longer.

Actual senses, still, are a strong prerequisite. As you move to Taoism, you are sure there are advanced exercises and some of them: you might learn without understanding them fully. While this mental world, principles of Attention and Healing themselves, are perfect, solvable and appear in philosophy of Mind; Taoism as philosophy of Body: notice that those material dimensions are still not perfect for you, but you might need to learn methods and practices, which unfold their meanings indefinitely. Still, your overall physical condition is much better to understand them, and to have realistic expectations.

So you:
Step 1: Learn objectives of Body Awareness Meditation; in parallel read this book for traditional sensitivity.
Step 2: Learn objectives of Body Awareness Practice; *the physical movement, which trains your system of Body and Mind*; imagine: by physical movement, you train the capabilities of your Mind, Brain and Health including Organs - surprisingly, the *Movement part of this is Physical*, and for each part such as movement and sensing, often you need exactly the movement to achieve the conditions of training and growth; indeed, you work with Mind and Body to grow - *the Sensations of This might be Mental*.

# My own general introduction

Buddhist meditation has 8 basic objects of meditation, one of them is Body:
- We assume Body as our First Object
- We assume Environment as our Second Object

You can see it's easy to extend the range of meditations - Environmental meditation is harder to explain, but it's part of Body Meditations as it relates our Physical, Mental and Spiritual bodies in their Awareness to external realities. Body is Aware of External Reality in such ways: external effects on it, and potentials of such external effects. Our Body Will is our movement of muscles and the basis of it - as we move our muscles, we are exercising intentions or acts of will, and as we move them in coordinated manner, we are exercising intent or material willpower of material kind. As we involve physical variables and realities, objective Void of it's causes and effects, in our Mind to resolve into Mental Decisions, it's the Material Willpower of our Mind; and our Facial muscles and organic Senses signal through people to acticate interperson muscle and nerve control and surrender, as well as internal and external control, and surrender - our faces are like accelerating vibrations, the center of our head is like a static reality of now, where the back of our head is related to ideals of it.

Ideals grow out from symbolism and attribution of material realities; where the metaphysics resolves in science, but dissolves in philosophy - giving up it's solutions and possibilities still have the chance -; by this and infinity principles, the Ideals then form an Ideal World, a Higher Reality. When it comes we believe and it has material presence, when it's still before unfolding, we would have Faith: the values of our realities will be once measured by how their potentials appear in future: this negative meaning is Womanly principle, the principle of Infinity or connecting the ends. Men have finities - they connect particulars and almost materialistically discuss their finite relations and structures.

When men bring so many things into marriage - house, car, work -; they build those things one by one - the problem men do not understand, which seems irrational by negative principle of irrationality, and is irrational by it's positive principle (I have 4 logical truth values of ponegation); women bring the qualities of it's ultimate outcome, especially related to initial will and willpower of Men.

Women surrender to Willpower to Men and Men are very Happy: they think they are training their muscles and becoming strong, looking into each particular finity of their force.

Women, as well, do exercise and succeed very much, but they watch how they train the muscles and nerves between decisions of men and actual outcomes: suddenly, each muscle of their faces, asses and legs with 180 degree flexibility are in tension, where they transcend their reality: to transcend your reality without work means to do it by moving. Men, often, have been moved to a place in social and material world, where men have been beaten - while women cannot control the will of men to decide, nor their success in general case, they appear very muscular in shifting the reality, the whole structure of it, into different place - men are now in house, which really looks like they are beaten by somebody, especially given their relations (a social position or house, a home); women definitely wanted this different man they now have, from the beginning and in this shift of space of time Women get closest to it - indeed, they *do not believe*, actually, that their past marriage was a marriage at all; their body, in this situation, rather had another life of effects of this other man. Where the beginning and end meets, women create a positional reality that they started together with their new man, with much better estimation of the ends. Well get deeper in it - why the men are singularity in the center, an individual, and women are multiplicity at the infinity in each direction, where they meet again each end with each beginning to form a space: mathematically, these principles cannot join into one, but they are infinitely in creative attraction. Prular nature of a Woman, who cannot be one, is visible in many particulars, where normally society of women is talking with a man, women are definitely working for society of men, and somehow: with even distribution of women and men, it always appears that a man is with several women over time, but woman can convince that they found the truth just right now and it's all just about this one man - which they then see in singularity.

From those weird things, it's sometimes funny and surprising to find out both still embody the full range of the opposite polarity - women, to survive, take decisions and lead, but might accidentially confirm it by child and family needs, while men work hard to connect their ends to beginnings, but suddenly it looks like very much made-up construction and not such stable and fluid as the reality of women, who are running around in the change of all those infinity positions: men, being very ironic about those changing conditions, are still trying to establish their first idea: while it was meant to predict many different outcomes, more and more it looks like a static machine which is like a car upside down: the wheels, by it's mechanistic solution, are still going round, the wheel is turned in mirrored direction from where it needs to turn, so as a machine and not an intelligence, it is in dream of where it's going, as he did not have exactly this condition. Women rather find an animal, which would slowly readapt and take to the same infinity direction.
