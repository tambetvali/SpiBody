# Vikings

I am half Viking, other half is quarter Cossack and quarter a central family of Blue Blood, among thousands like this.

Buddhism, then, while it's about to make me Enlightenment, it's also making me myself. Buddhism is turning my blood into Viking blood.

## YouTube songs


**OM MANI PADME HUM ｜ ARCTURIAN SONG #healingmusic #arcturian   #omani #mantrachanting**: My home star is Arcturian energy, which means I build a seed energy of this symbol in the sky: we are watching how the stars vibrate, and some of them we can understand. So many people understand the mystic color of Andromeda: the chemicals of these frequencies, especially their harmonic amplitude, makes the people see many such things in the Sky. We each have a Cosmic Archetype; one of them is of Earth: of the Milky Way Area of the skies (and populated planets to be very humanistic or human-centric; we measure the energy of the Sky: this is what the planet borns). So let's imagine a Vedic Arcturian to start this song..

**Nordic Fantasy： Relaxing Music With Powerful Female Vocals ｜ Frozen Fantasy World**: This is a Viking woman, and she runs with the wolves.

I did not want so much Nordic language, but rather English - each Viking sound can be done in old English, and this spellcraft language one needs to have the sorcery in between; not that we believe in sorcery, but particularly it's very hard to give one the meaning without it, especially in the "rock concert".

This is the Viking land - it's about like this, because they now live in Heaven haha:

**The 13th Aeon： The Secret Realm Outside the Matrix**

The favourite band of Vikings is Two Steps from the Hell: because Vikings do not love Vikings at all, because they love nobody, they like this neutral culture - there are definitely superheroes. Why we need to win the wars without Elves in such a hurried pace? No time to eat.

To question a nation, you have to question what they believe.

Vikings have some belief in Viking women:

**Winds of the North ｜ Relaxing Celtic Fantasy Music for Peaceful Sleep & Deep Meditation**: Celts, and their women, for example Nordic Elves are Vikings. This elve is sometimes pondering, apparently, whether she is so calm about Vikings, sometimes looking like fear of this and then like a Viking queen: especially she sings "We kings", because she is living in the Viking land. The barkeeper, a dwarf himself, seems to be overly convinced he is Viking himself.

**🌿 Crystalline Waters of the Elven River ｜ 2 Hours of Ethereal Vocals & Magical Elven Landscapes 🧝‍♀️**: Some more of them.

Viking women generally think they are elves, because with who they are left when Vikings are in war, even in inner war.

If you are tired, you can activate your inner power meanwhile: **Awakened Kundalini： Complete Guide to Activating Your Inner Spiritual Power**.

Then listen to Viking warrior beats: **[1 Hour] VIKING WARRIOR BEATS ⚔️🔥 ｜  Epic Norse Battle Music & Nordic Chanting 🛡️🩸**; when Elves go to war, Vikings are schocked and take the war very seriously.

# Viking Family

Vikings, by ancestry, are related to Elves: I don't know how many marriage there is, but to respect the ancestors culture, one has to respect the Elves. For German, there are also elves, and to English, there are fairies - much related to Elves.

From the birds, one must most respect the Raven, when they live in North: while small, gray raven are more like reflection in the Wind, Big Black Raven are mythical: just like Vikings, they like Towers of the Castles, so how can one not see a Viking: Ravens are able, in general, to talk and they are Wise.

From the Animals, Vikings like Wolves, but they are not so far from the Bear - the Siberian Bear, who likes to measure force with Siberians. Siberians, Eskimos or Innuiti, North American Natives - they are the closest neighbours. In each Viking main land, the North belongs to Innuiti, who are far from government and have their own "fairy tale", like Siberians in Russia: in North, there are not so many people to watch after other people, you are hopelessly mixed with five neigbours, and you cannot see farther nor easily walk: so your police officer would also work in the village and know everybody by each need.

Siberians and Vikings are physically magical: they relate, in this, to my other family Cossack, who is Zen and Tao despite very physical, and the Aristocrat, Blue Blood, who becomes magical by hands and heart at 40 years of age, doing heavy alchemy of Mind and Matter: just like others, Blue Blood does with their Body and their Intellect: because the real miracle is when you build bridges over the rivers, each person walking over the bridge, a miracle of engineering, carries a Spirit and Soul. So who likes to talk when you can do? Thus, they take a heavy exercise and reach, each, a different kind of Consciousness: much like Cossacks relate the Eastern North and Eastern South, my Viking-Russian mix of Blood relates the West and the East in this respect: Russian, Cossack and Chinese are already very much into Sanskrit, the Holy Land after the Siberia. Siberia is so cold that the plant you plant, the water you drink, must be magic; every step you take must be magic of getting your blood circulation: for Viking, Innuit, Native American, Siberian - each must practice Shamanistic Skill to get along with the Nature. So they plant a plant - this is full consciousness, full intent, and muscular work without respect to pain and tiredness; without miracles, those plants are not going to help you. Russians in the Center are Christians and Governors, such like Cofucius or Christ or Marcus Aurelius: they have to take care of the affairs with God and the Heavens. In South, this gets so warm that what can a Cossack do, or a Sanskrit man: they change every moment in Zen and Tao, and with Chinese, they cannot focus on philosophy of Mind - in Warmth, when the idea comes, you already start doing and when it colds down, you already start going; this must be a land of Mircales: when one does not plant a plant, it still grows; when one does not bring water, it still flows, and when one is not looking for people, they are still coming and coming - how can the magic of God, Zen and Tao not appear on it's own in this climate? With Central Russians, Christmas of middle of winter is the day for miracles: the day you look for balance and peace of mind, and bring gifts; where each 4 seasons are passing, the Centrals do understand the east and the north, and practice balance and peace and civilization: in summer, you are able, and in winter, you need, this is the civilization and lesson for christians (in bringing Heaven on Earth: a Civilization or beyond).

By relations in Ancestry, Vikings are like this:

```
                               Vikings
                             /         \
                           /             \
                         /                 \
                       /                     \
                     /                         \
               Elves                             Orchs
```

By camoflage, Viking women look and yell like Elves, similar to M.I.A. in her song "Channeler": this sound comes through the distances, far away, and still echoes looking for you. Elves are the ones, who sing dream songs to Vikings. Men, indeed, just talk and walk like Orchs, when they want: like Cossacks could look like Chinese or a Jew with Honour, as they mix into Jews, but bring the Chinese culture, and they posture must look right at north and south of border: then, in body and mind, Cossack cannot lack to understand Chinese in things like Zen and Tao, and they see Jews and Muslims over the Sea, but they are Russian by their Nation and Creed: with their own specific purpose. Similar to look this by Cossack, it is to have an Orch posture or words: indeed, contemplating about the mystical things, Viking contemplates on thoughts of Elves - the Fairies - and Orchs - the Undead; also about Dwarfs, who are ought to work in the North - with the Vikings taking the work as a religion, each of Elves, Orchs and Dwarfs have their work done: Elves never miss to bring you milk, bread and magic things; Orchs just do not say no to any work, because they are either working or having war, and the work is nothing - it is hard to stand still, so the work might also not be a favour; Dwarfs are constantly working to make **material magic**: while Vikings and Siberians have Magic Muscle, the Dwarfs rather make the Magic from Wood, Metal and Textile, so they have magic Crafts.

Read Tolkien in each of these respects: while the materials he studied might look boring, as the fairy tale language does not always give us this emotion of "big battles" or "things so critical to the whole village", rather we do not associate this with anything: when man from one village wins man of another village, or if that man behind the mountain got married. You think marriage is about kings and queens, who unite nations, or the superstars, and the Hero must be so grand as Hercule to make emotions about the fate of lands. Tolkien, then, studied these boring tales and made up a story, which starts and ends in this little Village and is not about much more when you start: you can see how invisible this is ..still the old man comes and brings the trouble behind the seas and forests, and one could meet those who are known from fairy tales: when men of the five races are already concernet, a modern person would feel something: it's not just a story of a man, who went to the sea with a ship, but rather a man, who passed the sea, the wild forest and the mountain; the village and the volcan - here, we can see different symbols are told.

Vikings are most related to Celts, in Spain we know Galicia and Valencian area, in Africa Vikings know the Shamans - in Spain the barbarian Shaman kings, who liked to work. They already landed to the Cossack area in areas, where Biblic stories took place. Catalunya, where I am currently living, is known by it's kings and pop culture - a red wood king, while some nearby areas remind more of Vikings and Celts: there is a genetic memory of the King, and it associates a metal-colored metal. All these nations: Vikings saw they work for furs and the food, for good tipis or houses and horses or other carrier animals, and thus there was understanding: each was a common, ancient nation. I think whole Spanish map, by provinces regions and their kings, is somehow genetically rooted: it reminds me of Mythical time, where Amazon river somehow passed from south America through this rain forest: a place in superhero movies; okay you can say genetic memory is rough.

A mythical place exists in Human Mind: Mortal Kombat (2021) movie or places where Elektra and War Princess Xena. This genetic memory is more like a dream: Deep within human blood and genetic memory lies a blurred realm — a place not bound by geography, where the shaman, in trance, walks from a northern rainforest to an African one, his drumbeats echoing through ancestral veins. This is not a real space, but a mythic echo, a space outside of space, stitched into us by memory older than thought. Time collapses here: warriors wear bronze and leather beside steel and neon, as seen in Mortal Kombat, Xena, Elektra — worlds where past and future coexist in sacred tension. It is Themyscira’s ageless island, the Celtic Green Realm, the arena where the tournament is for soul, not spectacle.

Movie: **The Fountain (2006)**

By one movie, we all started from Africa - notice this is based on myth and you have to contemplate on what each symbol *means*; but isn't this also what we commonly remember, which resonates with human blood?:
