Notice that this folder, while I call it "Viking tradition", is mostly about myself - some Viking music and some music I listen anyway.

Because this is morning, this is if you want some morning exercise from Shaolin:

Notice: in my consideration, Vikings and Celts are almost the same. As I have some Russian blood: while some Estonian might hate this, I have some Russian Christian blood: Celts, basically, combine Viking mysticism with Christianity - look at the modern Celts, especially. I see some Viking blooded Estonian might hate this very much, to see a cross in hands of Vikings: but I think for a true Viking, Celts, Elves, Orchs and Undead, each Northern race is the same. Because we *survived* the War; the genetic and cultural makeup we got from the Ancestors is rather the same.

Here is some Shaolin Performance, because I'm still seeking some pill for Immortality:

More of the Taoist - notice Vikings do not lack mental connection with this, I still find some cues from the past:

**ÊòìÁ≠ãÁ∂ì ¬∑ Yi Jin Jing (with Guided Breathing ¬∑ inkl. Anleitung)**

Well this woman so definitely yells for peace of soul that I do not mind lack of complete style:

**Master the Art of Flow ÔΩú Qigong Techniques for Inner Balance & Wellness**

**Taoist Mysticism and the Pursuit of Immortality Exploring Taoist Alchemy**

This is the Star Seed immortality - notice there are not many practical examples, because it's considered in-born, but there is some philosophy so I sometimes watch and ponder, what are the energies of the Stars and how they affect our makeup; but to which reality this belongs:

**Chosen Ones‚ú®You Are Immortal - From Human to Light !**

Now, while Viking can be of *any* Soul Family:
- Looking at different races, recognize your family and gene: humans and animals classify into certain families; all in Africa, East or Europe, even amongst Animals, you gonna find your Gene. In the fractal structure, there is a science called *socionics*: this is a metatruth which I express in my mathematics: equality, divided into two extreme frequencies (above and below infinity): the T fact, local fact is that you are equal if you are equal; the R fact, total fact is that you are equal if you are not equal. A corporation, for example, is *equal* if they have members from *all races*: this is where a corporation is gonna be *proud*: they got each of these different people holding each other's hands. Now, instead of being a locazen, be a ruler of the world: as we need to measure and rule *the World*; easily compete in this with me as a higher competition means producing Fruits together, so that the tension would relax and we live older. For my generations of Philosophy, some count that I have done them good in this skill; where they can compose a diverse World of Mine: do not forget, in Vikings we are all kings: so remember our Motto *We Kings*, shared by Vikings, Elves and the Landlords. What it means? Even American is *All Viking*: they come from Netherlands, Britain and all the Viking Countries, and they made Thor movie in series of Iron Man, their own Religion of Heart. For sake of those Vikings of Evil Lands dead, did not they die with honour? Did not they guess themselves guilty? Then, so can we: for Celtic family, Viking family, families of Each Northern Island, Grand or Small, and multiple of the Coast Areas, such as Netherlands and Galicia of Spanish King: each carries some of the Viking genome. Now look at dogs: do they not carry the genes of each human family? This is both inheritance and cultural gene building.
- Now look at Catholics: from Stone, they build big Castles and Monasteries, and they let the Towers face the Sky. Ignorant, so ignorant is Viking for the wordls coming from within; but the walls stand without: from stone are they made and high are the towers, so we each believe in angels. Each flying creature loves Stone Towers. Closer to God is this.

Why there are many Gods? Listen the **[1 Hour] VIKING WARRIOR BEATS ‚öîÔ∏èüî• ÔΩú  Epic Norse Battle Music & Nordic Chanting üõ°Ô∏èü©∏**: the song says, that when gods are in peace, humans get children and raise families; when gods are in war, human couples divide and families freak. Then, how can there not be multiple gods? This is common understanding amongst Vikings, despite many being Christians instead.

Why there is one God, then?

**Volkan Uca Feat. Ersin Ersavas & Semih Celikel - Ameno (Extended Mix)**

Because, while we are apart into the *Archetypal Families*, we also create one Whole through *socionics*.

In socionical fact, only as different families or genes, building a whole complexity of web, can we be equal with the Universe - the Ultimate Nature of each element doing it's endless work, which never ends but goes in cycles. In this diversity: each large thing, such as the Nature, is an endless dance of multiplicity, myriad and a nation or race of things; this way, to be equal inside larger wholes, ones need to be Different and True. Zen, then, is: each being finds their own True Nature. Confucian Truth is also called Tao, looking at I Ching - or, perhaps, it's *Change* as they have centralized the *Book of Changes*. Emperors might want to reside on power? But then, if the *I Ching* is a book of Emperor: we Zenists and Taoists are but mere Peasants with our personalized beliefs and cannot-do-nothings; the Christ called us for the Soul in Addition to the Spirit; and does not Buddha and Lao Zi finally extend into Heavens; then the Confucius was actually doing the thing of Christ: in Temple, he sacrificed and burnt wood and paper with magic words; older man becomes physical and his act becomes a ritual: is not this the physical thing about society, to send money to the Dead?
