# Traditional Methods of my Meditation of Mind and Body

We live in the Mind and Body: we have the eternal, visonary and communicative Mind along with Warm-Heated, Egoless but Selfish, Emotional and Materialist Body, an ultimate Calculator of Reality: for it's functions, it's a chemical apparatus like a supercomputer. While you have eternal computer made from Reactor and Logic, you have body computer - made from Reactor and Logic. You have flesh and exercise in both: in Computers, you have the reactive information and essence of reaction, while you also have statically growing methods of Logic and Reaction, the Root and the Crown of your Philosophical Essence, generalization into categories: these categories appear in Fractal of Theories, where each application to separate body part provides a Theory: it's gene, experience and prevision or precognition.

Here, I describe the Meditation and Mindset, which follows the Tradition.
