# Magic of the Gene

Let's try to believe in Scientists claim:
- Genetic memory, while it is not direct memory, provides negative memory: once you get along with things you remember genetically, you *recognize* them. So it's a memory of *recognition* rather than memory of *remembering*: once you Recognize, you Remember.

From tradition of teaching Dalai Lamas: at age three, each candidate is shown some things from their previous lives. Once they *recognize*, they are chosen: notice it's a test of *recognition*, not *memorization*: the latter would conclude a test of asking nothing, getting answers, which is at least a slower process.

So: the memory of the past, of the broken apart selves, either your ancestors or past waves of your cognitive, conscious experience: whatever are you, either genetic, soul or personality code: in case you are your Ego, you recognize your teachers and students in their common structure of Personality. Each of those is a ripple of dimensions of karmic consciousness: it's not so important, which ones we believe; because once the conception is empty and fits all, it will optimize into the same behavioural model. You equation: who are yourself; it can *actually* be dependent on those deep connections to different aspects of you - it's information similarity and energy flow, which connects into conscious units and individualizes into different, coherent principles - equal locally and different globally.

Then, there is a heavy magic of the gene:
- Let them listen the music, watch the things, and experience the experiences of their ancestors; magically: this results as if they remembered each of those.

So when you are told "this can evoke genetic memories in you" or "this can evoke past-life memories in you" or "this can evoke your intuitive knowledge of who you are": the aquaintance with past will evoke the gene memory, while aquaintance with the future will bring the dream consciousness - you, as well, can see the future visions in the evolving patterns of the archetypes, fractals or even spiral shapes; in the deeper and deeper logic of future unfolding - once you read I Ching oracle stories or study Tarot cards (I throw coins with I Ching but I do not believe in random Tarot cards so clearly - I fear them); basically: the stories, without any lucky guessing, develop an understanding of the archetype; study of I Ching develops some natural ability to see causes and consequences of things, and subsequently the future or even the past from it's waves (if you read backwards). Each Tarot card, for example, is a motive, which destinies your life very sharply.

What is gene magic now:

It can connect ourselves to our traditions:
- For example, being from far apart in the world; play together the Ancient African Rituals, even your own developments - this would evoke memories of your families together.
- Having been apart for so long: play the ritual of United Future World. This could evoke arcetypes, which also brings gene or spirit memory of superglobal civilizations.

Notice, if Soul is the Eternal Unity and the Spirit is the Divine (eternal appearing locally or in relation to local events, such as intervention or local god or spirit):
- Soul remembers the Future. Over all, it remembers the purest archetypes of unitedness and eternity - it has the common logic or intuition for ultimate future, ideal, perfection; while this never comes, it must be above Space and Time.
- Spirit remembers the Past. It remembers the tribes, spirits and families; it gives unique importance to each. Even the Grand Spirit is nothing but a Horizon (total, but like one of the many, with it's material locality)..

Local God: you can define it as a God, which was born only to your area: in this you won't recognize the deeper principle behind reincarnations, but you see the *personality* or *EGO* of God, which is just a mortal principle lasting for Eons; this is the mortal principle of God, one which is not passing by often. Each Civilization is reincarfnation of God: which came first, are the youngest in their genetic makeup, and which came last, are the oldest. You follow Spirits instead of Gods if each small tribe had a God, and then they unite.

Chakras of Human History:

**The First Unification - Childhood; Rebellion - the Youth:**
1st, the Root Chakra: Shamanism. In unity, each race was together in rhythym of drums; each was so mortal.

2nd, the Emotion Chakra: Alchemy. The races had broken apart, individuation was dark; they started to mix chemicals - emotions of the Mind; elements so mixed.

3rd, the Solar Plexus: Magic. Thought and Will powers were invented, and the powers invented started with machines - atoms so separate.

4th, the Heart Chakra: Religion. Each of the numerous ways were now seen so unique, and the Mortal Discipline of Humans was defeated: in Space, the human essence does not die in numerous relationships; in Time, the human essence does not die in generations; without space and time: you, the Unit, are so important; and over the space and time: God, the Unique Alone as each is Unique in Themselves, also so important. The dream of passing realities fades away: you now have to Work, to know the Good and Bad, to Stand in Honour in Your Life and Let the Others Stand in This.

**The Second Unification; Enlightenment:**
5th, the Communication Chakra: Science. Common principle understood by all, clearly expressed, defined; the philosophy and science of Truth. Humans started a conscious engineering of Material Structures: the the Communication is the Material Force, bound to Space and Time. This is really the Roots - the tales of the past; much like Root chakra.

- This point here is the last division before the present moment: we are, right now, bringing the Vision into the Science.

6th, the Vision Chakra: Buddhism; secular superreligions like Freemasonry and other Secret Societies. Humans started a conscious engineering of the Social and Civilized structures. The Vision is the Holotrope form, holograms and fractals in your Mind - one cannot say humans learn to see, to contain the vibration of light; rather we see so well in each direction. Vision Chakra does not enable us to Far Sight so definitely as it does this: through fractal topology and the structural dimension we give a global, universal meaning to this. This is really an Unity, much like Solar Plexus.

- Here is a first peak, where different Religions, Secular Models (Natural Sciences) and Mind Models (Paradigms) start representing what Trinity means - a positive paradox of Separation and Unification.

7th, the Crown Chakra: This is the Infinite Finitum, Laegna (science of mine) being one attempt for this. Crown sees the ultimate reality as a point dimension: but it's aspectual; each piece of the hologram contains the image of whole reality, but each of them adds a dimension to it's flattened form. While Science of Religion is about whole reality: in Crown, we see a metasystem of Secret Societies, Sciences, Religions and Traditions, each gathering some wholes; we see how each person is Unique, but contains the Whole aligned with centers and extremes of this Uniqueness. We can see multiparadigmatic consciousness very painfully appearing: Conceptions in God's Mind are rather such; so the birth of Scientific Explanation of God, the local understanding of your fractal piece and fractals around you - you start to move in how the Metaphysics Unfolds; you are not running away from the past (Communication), or acting in the present (Vision), but gravitizing towards the future (Crown). In this period, we are building God bottom-up - we recognize the infinite dimension, and build it on the social basis; with conscious knowledge about what a ritual is - Empty - we build our Christian and Confucian schools and resolve the Hermetics (notice it sounds like "Thermodynamics": it reminds of closed systems in an open space).
- Trinities: in Hindu and Christian Trinity, the paradox for this, also in Multigod religions - to polarize the opposites instead of dividing them, we see how each is whole truth (each reincarnation of God is whole God; each frequency of God is whole God); we see how each is separate personality.
- Metaspace: each singular unit is point in metaspace, which forms the whole space. Movement in this space is movement of your whole life, of (ultimate / eternal) meaning of your Total Reality; exploring this is exploring the reality through possibility - this realm is rather virtual, where each play is a ritual possibility of beginning and end of the Universe; I call them with letter "^R", where unresolved problems evoke unresolved realities, and the solutions slowly dissolve into a single reality - Turing paradox will never get you out of a Dream, out of a single reality, nor will it never collapse the Ultimate Superposition of the Field. The infinity is ever-expanding and each Total Reality will grow in energy into two: more total reaity and a leaf of it, the past-present condition. Time and Space flow in the structure of Potentials, which open up like a Schroedinger Field - you bring those causes and resolve them into consequences, and resolve the consequences into bricks of the Total Reality, Hypereternal dimension leading to Eternality.

Below the Root chakra and above the Crown is the Potentiality: the External Realm. Your futures unprocessed and your pasts unresolved, even before-unexistent (imagine the properties of Schroedinger's Field) they exist here in shape of root under your foot and the fire or crown above your head - you experience this, but integrate the experience; it lights the 7 chakras in you, which are the Eternal Totality, but not it's development. God's Space is rather the development of Eternal Reality: as the Time Itself, in it's Totality, and Space Itself, in it's Totality, is raising through the Potential Field, Illuminating and Unfolding: the Real Creativity resides here, and as we produce this effect, we slowly illuminate into Matter of God - uniting all those Chrowns, the Ultimate Chrown of our Cooperation is a Principle, which slowly melts into the Totality Uniting all the Opposites - this is the Principle of God.

Here, the reality becomes a fractal - we pass the Chakras of next levels of Systems. We pass on stars so far that we almost don't hear each other or cannot record those contacts any more; as we remain sending ships farther and farter, and to overcome each barrier in distance. As we come back together, we are different races, but able to live amongst different complex elements and conditions. Our religious goals - the last shamanist / alchemical goal of Humankind is to overcome shutdown of the Sun; the next religious goal is to bring life after the final cooldown or a major change in the Totality as we then see it - for example, if it cools down, we need measurement of accelerated space and time and what is left to fluctuate or unite, what is now local, and what is the movement in space; we need to invent life and pass our genesis program there - imagine if this already happened.

Notice that while it's quite clear from Shamanism to Science, last two steps are somewhat an invention - Buddhism being the Vision where Science simply resolves mundane affairs; and indeed my own tries to evoke my Crown chakra result in my own science.

Now think of 7 historic chakras of your cells!

Chakras of your life:
- Birth is Root: you are very happy to demand and fulfill your physical goals.
- Middle Age Crisis evokes the Solar Plexus: you build your own life.
- Old age brings the Vision chakra, enlightenment or Crown: you build a society.
