# Some music videos inspired by Somatic Visions or associated annotiations on words

"**S.O.M.A. - Beyond Mind**" - this is a short anthem to Soma.

"**Desert Dwellers - One Giant Consciousness Feat Paul Stamets (Visuals) [Full Album]**" - well this somehow aligns with Somatic Fractals.

Notice your body likes visual and sound. Vibrations irrational to you might remind it of very concrete sonmethings, as well as sensations related to colors, patterns, etc. Shamanic method is much based on color and sound, movement and the natural elements in their dance.

"**LIQUID SOMA - Dharma [Full EP]** - this is the Indian sound of the Somatic World.

"**A Breath of Release ｜ Somatic Meditation ｜ Guided #Breathwork Meditation**" - this is going to guide you through the breathwork. Notice I do not know breathwork myself.
