# It's none of Magic

Magic is not at all about Magic: it's not about the mystic secret, which provides the influence of ideal over the material without any means. We are not passive, but we are active in our pursuit for Health, for Ethics of Health.

"Sensitive", in my sense, is never attracted to reality-breaking, unnatural response, like a *wicked witch*:
- Sensitive person is a sensitive of their Material Senses: having practiced material attention of their physical realities, their Material Senses are purifying.
- Intuitively sensitive person responds to creative, intelligent realms of seeing this realm, which grows up into common experience of our reality, and forms an image, in senses, visualization methods or intellectual imagery and fantasy, which are all equal by our guide to spiritual uniqueness: Spiritual person is object to statistics and the exceptions, which prove the Theorem for Spiritual person, and it's uniquely exceptional for a Spiritual Person to be guided by matter, for objective or subjective reasons to build their sensitivity upon material and real-science, real-mathematical basis. Exceptional Scientist always fits the actual lines of the sensitives: an average sensitive rather has quoted Einstein by union of Authority with their Faith and Belief in God and Higher Realities of Lower Beings.

Materialist is not a so much lower being for a Spiritual Individual: despite they operate in lower dimension of mental axes, their intellectual and creative pursuits can, in Crafts and Arts, including the ex-Karmic Protection (karma is payment) and in-Karmic Creation (trade objects are objects to karma, both material and spiritual forming an enlightened government: Spiritual Person has reached decent levels of Constitution in Spiritual and Material Realms, and enjoys Civilized Cooperation).

We do not unite Religions, but we unite Philosophies: each might be doubting a lot, and each has given some answer to uncertanties: the best answer in Buddhism and Philosophies is called Void, it's the principle of Fool: you don't know. In this not knowing, where numerous causes and effects constitute a reality, which is free of ultimate truth and final judgement - thus arrive the Equal Rights of Good and Bad, where we do not know who is Right - we look an Empty View, which fits all.

Empty View is not rational. Ration has dimensions, which can be made from linear particles of space and function, drawing direct lines to ultimate infinities, zeroes and relations in finities: logical cube is such a direct line of repetition, and ethical framework with it's stable coordinate systems cannot get out of the "Box of God", a way where we do not measure our eternal situation in particulars.

What is our eternal situation? The eternal reality is Empty and Void: it does not contain any guaranteed reality for us. It Exists: our Ultimate Victory, the growth of Life and anything what comes Past, the "Past-Life", where we relate to ancestors. We measure, more by each second, day, year, but even more with every big experience such as looking back to long life: the past by it's outcomes in future, and what we could have previsioned. It takes the curve up, and pays for each thing in the past by over and over relating the value of our money.

We have to provide Constitutional Bridge through the Spiritual and Material essence of us: our left and right shoulder. Shoulders, while normally kept in free position a little towards the future, front of us, can assist in many structural systems of body - for example, heads wide apart form an easy system to connect hands and body so that we could lift and move our body easily with hands, typically for some time. From the "Anatomy and Physiology" book, I also got an impression that there are reengineering effects on the bones; where you should find these and other functions of your body bone structures. This is the holistic engineering of a human to change postures.

What connects the Spiritual and Material Realms:
- We are like in a movie, where Material and Spiritual realms co-stream one Body with it's activation of will and senses. We do not want to know their Sources, as the Sources are Mystical: to know the Sources, we learn that the Mind is Empty. We see this Illumination of the World coming through our senses: senses of body, mind, and intellectual and being activated by our will: activation by muscles, balance and intellectual solutions.
- Spiritual is more activated by their Mystical Vision of Reality Around them and Inside. They see the Irrational Dimensions, which has no single goals: for example, in Evolution and Survival, each skill is measured and there are no single skills to survive, but rather Empty Patterns not associated to any specific Law of Physics, Separately. Still there are Laws of Reality. The essence consists of many particular Motives.
- Material Realm appears Close, and while it's also Empty of Intent, the Intentions of the Objects are there and appear as singular, articulable functions generalized into some kind of engineering system of logic and reality. With movement, the physical matter can be altered, and with senses it can be seen.

Spiritual person does not see merely by senses: we sense by Mind. Properly, to be Spiritual is Higher, because Spirit is about Uniqueness: it involves Spiritual and Material on the First Level. Material sees what is Common: unlike the ever-expanding, the patterns are repeating slow enough to give us repetitions: stone age people, monkeys and even mice still reproduce, have families, eat and get rid of toxins, they breathe like us and think just like us about many particular things, such as carrying, getting there, finding a hidden spot or reaching their beloved one. Hardly can we see what is so distinct about human thinking.

Shamanism connects us all to prehistoric tribes, where we lived closeby like families: in Africa, Chinese could still be a neighbour to european: notice this neighbour was a Shaman.

This, by genetic memory: ChatGPT told it's scientific to think that all of us humans, by gene memory for adaption to certain traits means that we can easily adapt to Shamanistic tradition and ritual together - european Believer, Native American or Taoist might find their common tracks in cultivation as if they were family friends. When those families were neighbours, they practiced Shamanism and the practice dated back for long.

What was made in progress - Alchemy, Magic, Ritual, Religion and Metareligion / Science; in this we are connected by Future and not by Past: now as we can see each others, again, we feel like neighbors again, and learn so much of physical skills from each others, get so many childs, that we look very much the same.

Youth is sayd to be union in naive bliss; the youth is separation into rebelhood; and the old is enlightened mind - we have scientific enlightenment, collective event starting from times of enlightenment and recognition of scientific principles, Mind of the Collective Mind; we have religious enlightenment, individual event which has propagated, accumulatively like Series of Fibonaccy (typically doing that in Nature, being in symmetry of will) - each Satori of each Person puts them into Emptiness, which helps to Fullfill the Whole: the Whole is not even God, because God is Whole and Whole is projecting itself to Space and Time, and generations of Space of Focus of Time and Growth of it's Unity and Discrimination or Individuation of Times: in both space and time there is fractal of time and space; they become two-dimensional, space with two complete spatial dimensionalities and time with two complete temporal dimensionalities: this flow we see becomes such two-dimensional, with higher-order base or pre- dimensions, that potential field - imagine the Quantum Physics: reduction of superpositions especially as used in quantum computers to release the right or high-energy, preferred solution in either rational or previsionary hidden, Empty Space of Reason or Empty / Monkey Rationality, where we see only the forms funnily changing shapes: while we can repeat the Shapes and it looks so Funny; we cannot repeat the Essence. Notice our theory is not based on complicated sciences such as quantum physics, but we state in theorem about systems: it is either inherent or the system would find and unify superposition combinations on many layers of logic to work in union, and this is not important whether such "extramaterial" effect as instant cognition of multiple possibilities resolving into high-energy and equilibrum solution; rather, if it resolves over evolution of time, it would resonate so commonly that still seem to be the ultimate reality, dead reason; we can see so many metaphysical entities in possibility field - we are philosophical, open-minded, and notice we go through this space and time in patterns and repetitions, and those have no solid essence: in so many actual possibilities would they hint to any underlying reality; we are not specifically doing this or that thing, but we are doing something mystical and irrational: yet, by philosophy of Action, Tao, and philosophy of Perception, Zen, we are perfectly capable of doing this thing. We can relate life of Humankind with the one of Human - union, separation or rebellion, and the late union into higher unities: the realm of Superego in Old People, who are more Collective and Family Oriented, greedgiving.

For each exercise, we measure the highest purpose of Sensitive of Super performance with those whose material, essential roots are easy to track down - such as relying solely on Sound, and being efficient in presence of vibrations of bodies to know something about them. When we are sensitive to our surroundings: even our material sense data begins to be inseparable from Magic, it's base reason hard to explain as it's Empty: we can react properly to each sense, without separate causes and effects, but our Mind is to go Smooth; while the Material is of Repetitions, in Spiritual the Growth and Creativity form a single function (Growth of Body and Mind) with it's repetitive basis (Creativity of Body and Mind).

# It's Tradition

Traditionally, a Saint, Prophet, reincarnation of anything related to Soul of God or the Spirit of Land; of Father or Mother God, their Union or Separation into Different Personalities, their Fractal of Beings, where higher Angels are Godly and Godlike, often found their place in "Hierarchy of Gods".

Sanskrit Trinity: one Godly Essence is born into Three Gods. To associate this into original belief of each three religions: these are either Reincarnations or Oscillations (Avatars) of God. These are the frequencies, where harmony between Master or Major Octaves appears: as Infinite Scale and Finite Scale have harmonic vibration, the information, thus or from physical information and energy moving through Cone or Conus dimension of frequencies of Infinity: their simplest dimension is 1 to 2 relation, where heavy amount of Energy, movement patterns of Sound, Light and Information even-odd (with harmonic and disharmonic dimension, numbers, energies and matters either on same or different dimension); they reach to Time from Space Singular Hyperdimension - we see this flow of essence, energy and material form templates holographically from up to down, and we see many fundamental, unique properties such as the structure of chakras - functions efficiently positioned on these scales, for example head for higher-visionary, body for lower-visionary, hands for higher-motional and legs for lower-motional. "Visionary" means Body does not move much, but keeps it's structure; and Head does not resolve each particular case, but common patterns and unique, general variables - to ask for cake does not mean to ask for every particular action like cooking and farming, but one single question is empty of this matter of fact; we do not discuss each particular reason and effect of eating, digestion and energy, but we know this for single, empty purpose and reason: to exchange energy, associated to eating.

Zen of Present Moment is to let go of the Present Moment as it worries you: you cannot understand the Present Moment, nor it's meaning and position in your life; it burns you out that with each explanation, hint into unfolding of the actual meanings, where meaning is vibrant and alive in the past - dimensions and values of meanings, either good and bad, live in past as well as they live in the present; in our estimations, they are moving in the future.

There is the two-dimensional butterfly effect: we produce butterfly effect affecting each reality behind the value as we re-evaluate it, and the reality is changing as we understand it; we change, in butterfly effect, as the reality is adapting to our new value. In around the moment, instead of Time, we have complex Space: many equal possibilities. Zen is Empty and Void of particulars: each of those is solid and we see, in each of them some common scales appear: their internal space is fractal of local coordinates, but frequential oscillation f means they have common directions in Time: with some function uniting these Space and Time, each possibility has a direction to move forward, and directions of obstacles: Philosophy aligns with Science, and this Zen is Born, when our Reality is Free of Particulars. We do not know whether this lover would betray our love and let us go, or make our love tired so that we cannot stay, or we would find new and new, fresh reasons to stay aligned and resolve this Emptiness and Void: our material body, our mental spirit and activities, for Man and Woman, would they not resolve into one frequent body of physical union, and so many mental layers of physical and mental unions, of cooperational union in this "society of two": as Confucius said, Family is the basis for Society, for Civilization.

In presence, in Butterfly effect of Ourselves and Realities, which both try to recognize the actual, final state of each: logic eliminates itself, causes and effects vanish, and instead the logic is starting to break and rejuvenate the reality: to find out what can actually happen.

# Miracles and Magic

Notice: I do not say effects are not becoming instant, or foreseeing the time, and more global rather than local. We see this in things like radio, television and estimations of Artificial Intelligence - we see this in human effectiveness. It *is* the attribute of Mind to invent and reach such solutions, which render our previous constraints now seemingly going backwards in time: looking at Shamanic society, and the one of ours; many things of them would now seem taking so much time that rather we can say, today we are getting instant, magical and non-local results, and creators of our tools definitely foresaw most of our conditions, which appear - we do find some kind of button or tool to resolve this, instead of passing sagas, eposes and long fairy tales to *now* get this nail in the wall or this message to this other person. For example, clubs and big cities mean that finding a kind of fit woman for us, compared to past - we cannot say the same effect is not happening instantly and right here, often we click some buttons and we have a chance to have the same initial conversation, would it succeed or fail. Instead of building a house, we just buy it.

Generally, in magic and miracles: yes we are talking of very great advancements, but we are not breaking the hermetic / thermodynamic laws of still working hard and having a slow progress; we see the general rhythym of life: it's rather Spiritual to accept it, than coming to "measure" some kind of impossible results and effects. And yes: the personal picture is very often dramatic; this kind of, happens with first love, but eventually you have rationalized out that while it's so dramatic now, the new love, like an ultimate breaktrhough in natural laws - claiming it to be so, we cannot see that each, measurable, love is so dramatic, but alltogether they consist of many very similar stories. Whether the love is magical or not - it's true for spirituality and religion, they are the same magical. Why? Because they are talking about love :)

So, clarify this:
- Material realm is a material realm.
- Spiritual realm is the spiritual realm.
- We have to understand their numerous relations and not talk so easily about "infinite riches": while our riches really are infinite, and it's a real breakthrough, we are still ones of countless many having very similar stories, and it's also hard to point out what is so much better in relationship of spiritual people, than the one of materialist people (without any particular attributions, such as violence or special understanding - even those are not so immaterial).

The idea realm - in sense that it's the information, idea, more holistic and grander view; we must understand that these properties themselves, are not so far from science. What is far from science is expectation of *extreme success* - so, telling that magic is not magic, I mostly mean that instead of extreme success, we find our theories of business, limitations and obstacles, social and personal problems etc.: being more or less in place.

If the science is about the limitations, and about being anxious rather than delusionary about the such - spirituality won't get us so much out; rather, in spiritual world, the common atheist and materialist problems remain; it's a history full of failures to say our new methods would not meet the problems of past generations; we are wobbling from extreme to extreme. Our Spiritual World could be deep and efficient: but we got to solve the same problems in chemistry, physics, programming, society, peace and war and conflict - just "deciding peace" or "creating a power mind", while it could help, we must see very clearly, in material aspect, that this "power mind" is actually coherent in matter, which means it's training, studying, and working on it's object, rather than trying to get very distant from it and achieve it's means by not touching it - for black magician, this is a good way to do it, but the essence of Spirituality has rather good style and flow in material world, doing it *better*, not *getting without*.

This also cannot be true unless we still see - in proper objective, each scope is correct; such as fast development in sense of enlightened minds, and need to take time for long-term goals, having kind of sacrifice in short term goals. Here, we have to balance many opposites and conflicting factors, even set up the proper percentages of how much we need different people and how much they need to do; also letting this be creative, and they themselves rolling their own dice (to build a fractal distribution made of local probabilities, even easily fitting different systems). What we need to know is that we need to contemplate over "taste of one", rather than an "ultimate taste of one".

# Metaphor and a Concrete

We build it from the Concretes, in the Space of Metaphors. Space is defined so: your condition is changed without visible movement - for example, with a plane, you pass from Stockholm to Colorado, remaining almost still and fixed in Meditation Posture. A granite stone would, then, not by properties of it's constituents and their transmutation: to transmute now Colorado to Puerto Rico would be insanely great transmutation, so we do not use the base 4 elements. Still, we gain changes in condition, such as air pressure, humility and temperature, using the Space element: we do this transistion in Space, using Plane - a vehicle made from Metal (this is the Taoist fifth element, a bone to the Space; moving machines and parts are typically made of Metal, so think of this as Hermetic Opposite of the Space).

Metaphor is about movements and changes in Metaphysical Space. My name for science to learn about Physics of Mathematics (how element properties apply to your conscievable mathemathecs and logecs, respectively to how "ideal and unreachable" would then the classic mathematics and logic turn out to be, with it's "immutability" where every fact of each, is residing in material world).

Metaphor is "E" or "Infinite" parallel to a Concrete - respectively "A" or "Finite".

When our Mind is doing Acceleration to Velocity of Matter, where they might overlap to some degree or time lag, we Creatively accelerate the matter: acceleration is multiplication of Point and the Whole, a two-dimensional contiinum of velocity; in mathematical terms, multiplication and division do in two-dimensional space, what addition and subtraction do in one-dimensional space: thus, it's acceleration towards velocity. We call this higher extreme octave and lower extreme octave; here we divide the infinite into two: where countability ends and non-countability starts, which is marked as 90 degrees line direct angle, where 180 is Infinity Number of mine. This is two initial leaves of Fractal of Reality in terms of Math.

Necessarily, in this upper and downer octave (I use "downer" instead of "lower" in regards to meanings of letters in my own language, where I never speak solely non-fit dialect of letters here in terms of my own theories and their explanations): we use same numbers. Number systems in lower octave, by which we directly measure the material objects and their structures, are replaced with "poetic", "abstract" or "intellectual" in higher primary leaf from infinity.

In this high frequency live the humans: we accelerate matter in sense of using nonlinear solutions to material processes, where matter itself would use linear solutions. Having human body is already an efficient solution to this problem; and necessarily: as this cannot be purely ideal object, with having quantities, which is our Immortal Mind, the principles of this ideal, set of qualities, is in octave harmonics with material - problem and solution vibrate up and down, like giving and receiving. Like Woman and Man principle: initially one number, it turns into windows of two octaves - numbers on higher and downer line of write, the digits up and down where I divide line of text into higher and downer half. Text, in my language, consists of numbers: notice text on higher and lower line do not represent coherent whole, unless the same number of digits are used, and ordered in the same way. Resulting in existence of metaphor and the concrete: the same semantics is used in mental and material plane, first is the creative effort of our Minds, which does not change directly the structure of matter, despite having some direct effect on our bodies and it's objects: science turns this relation to body into magic, as well as our exercise, such as meditation and development of Soma, if we draw this word favour from the Somatic Meditation book. This continuous analogy turns into magic - for the space and it's content, we reach the same numbers in math, and words and sentences in language, for different frequencies to have coherent, thus existing number or language use.

Symbol, then, is able to reach the same metaphoric parallel in numerous images of the fractal. Paradigm will find parallels for logic spaces, theories, in fractal of image of space projection systems. In each projection system, you reestablish the basic logic, or business theory, or any tautology, but in local space you see very different coordinates. Consistent models of reality can be reached in each view to it, where we see kind of "altered states of mathematics" - mathematics of mine, here, is very simplistic about containing fractals and infinities. I am personally struggling with this in classic math: into complex equations. I was closely following that I could use my mind centers, such as Chakras, to do calculations of Math - so it's very symmetric and simple in relation to how we do calculations and synchronize the information naturally with Mind Centers. Finally, mathematics and logic are synchronized into coherent flow, and where I see logarithm and exponent as base necessity of dimensions as exponent is the only function growing to infinity, I was once sayd - I could not confirm, but I need one exponent function to express growth to infinity on a straight line; so it's a question of whether math exists, if you cannot linearize it - speedup and slowdown this function on symmetric, interest-including local angle disposition with global compensations: but those are not qualified as very "simple", thus it's questionable whether they are necessary function, or could constitute of simpler functions and some data in space we can imagine and process.

This fundamental reality cannot be more flexible than the material bodies it constitutes of.

Fundamental "Need" is an approach to form consciosuness - future-directed approach to the matter, where in center, "optimized-from-past" becomes "neglecting-the-future", cause-and-effect-based becomes goal-based. Both projections appear: cause-and-effect-based, and goal-based, and we speak of "internal" and "external"; still they have dependent nature as Buddha would say: the internal is the idea, and it's sole reason is to optimize, and generalize, the external: so it's not very resilient or having it's cause efficient solution if it's not *acting*; to to have reason to *be*, it now needs to *act*. Fractally, certain sets of forces have to appear: then, we see the same families amongst elements, star systems, animal and human family dispositions as well as between races: different stereotypes repeat from race to race, simpler one even among humans and animals, and theorems of consistent matter, capable to exist, seem to repeat in humans and the matter.

There are famous tests, which are claimed to "disprove" existence of Soul or Mind: for example, scientists found out that body does not lose mass as we die; so they ask, how it could have energy by laws of Einstein?

Quantitative laws hold very well, and our Universe seems not to get stuck into impossible states - so, what kind of dangers can be seen from the future, flowing to the past? If no estimation or oracle exists, then what logical law exists? Because, if we are not neglecting the future: it would become impossible. As the now of the past turned now out to be possible, and each Natural Law did not lead to states of inconsistency - is the logic of this Space consistent itself, each variable statically safe in a closed circulation? But logically, then: if we cannot say what kind of reasoning of causation we cannot to from future to the past, then what kind of lack of negative force is there - the Nature, in a very deep sense, is not making a logical mistake? Because if the Logic is the Natural Logic, "mistake" would be simply equal to "impossible".

From *optimization* we can already imply *incompleteness* or *imperfection*: this is the basic essence of growing precision not only in our knowledge about the Nature, our body and artificial creations, but also in Nature, our body and it's creations themselves. The tree, over million years, is much *more* a tree, and a mathematical number much more of itself. The future generations will not be less, but more humans than us - a futuristic alien, having integrated each positive, excluded each negative aspect of humans, would pretend to have *stronger protection* by humanitarian laws, human identity: it would be *more human*, not regards whether the human body won the competition, or they made new bodies; or whether a human body is now one selection of transcending system: human itself, historically, is examining with divine attribution: for human body, the ability to grow wings, and lose them at will, would be *more human*, while solely having wings might be *less human* unless it's a specifically conditioned planet, where flying is very efficient factor of harmonious frequencies, aspects of life: it would optimize out the losses in our flexibility of body.

Our mental eye, then, already has symbolics: it sends us the imagination of wings, for example on TV Screen (Red Bull Advertisement) - the viewer, not seeing non-human (like a big bug would seem, even with some human features), will see human having metaphorical high.

This means a funny fix: where, at your physical body, you cannot grow and remove wings at will, your fantasy screen of yourself would compose wings from your mental high flow, or from car, wife and the house - person consisting reasonable set of such wholes is seen as having wings, when we imagine with our mental eye. For definite verification of such Auric presence, we cannot ask from single entities with their own personal truth to get definite answers - the logic of symbols rather appears on TV Screen, the fact of common understanding. We can see energy auras, which very mentally represent the real objects - a red bull bottle with wings represents you after you drink it, and you are now flying. This is a dream paradox of human: how to have wings without really having them? Masters of Planes, Honourers of Eagles, and Speakers of this Metaphor Language. Or like sentences that "you cannot live forever without being died for once", representing the Ego death and resurrection into Mind's coherent mental and physical picture of your activity.

Now: the Mind is reasoned by Body, the Body by Matter; but then the Matter is accelerated through transmutation by Body, and Body is object of transmutation by Mind - both planning it's tracks, and having the mental guidance in each general, external aspect. Now why we so much need to be in external world?

We can not do two things at once, but we can activate each brain function at once: so the "one thing", life we live and it's context we overlive, it's parts we live under, we have back brain in world of Metaphor, front brain in world of Concrete. We deduct this simply from connections - facial muscles reflect the local space directly, but the back-head seems rather standing still and moving "slower than it grows muscles", in sense that we primarily sense only it's force: it resonates to the context of our reality. Top brain, then, especially the point at top of your head, is the totality - it's like Solar Plexus of brain functions left and right, front and back, perhaps up and down (depends on your definitions). Bottom of brain is already more like an oral system: this already plugs us over wifi or bluetooth, using the sound vibration. Body can vibrate as well and cause sounds, in various ways (even through movements) - especially well, it can sense low vibrations such as heart rate, which is often simulated to entertain it in addition to entertaining the mind, the central organs. For ears, such typical vibrations are somewhat destructive in high amounts so we don't know how they are modified in the future: but they all will want both concrete and the metaphorical, so even in times of extreme virtual reality, people want even deeper material structures: and to manipulate this thing, the experience is similar to training our body and perhaps, if you trained better in virtual reality, more trained body could be plugged: but in each case you would go through similar amounts of pain, altough the virtual reality could be more or less fine-tuned. One of the Masters whose articles I did read (I cannot find the source now) mentioned that by visualizing a training, one can also grow muscles - imagine the body as being able to grow, on it's natural forces, but the whole complex ecosystem of atoms, cells, nerves, muscles and perceptors, even external influences: it needs a very good balance between life and training to have it's holistic growth. Rhythmic and monotone movement is then: a startup point, where the body behaves in it's simplest way. In time and posture space, we break this into more complex patterns, much like learning a musical instrument: then, even, it breaks into separate movements, as the *organs get their localized brain structures*. In regards to any practical matters, so the philosophical outcome: it's enough to train them into capability to move, and perhaps have some training to overcome coordination and nerve problems and to have correct imagery about the movement and sensations (more complex positions or tired states can remove this information, so that you are not capable to continue the movement - but do a random movement; body, often, creates such "random" movements as a prerequisite training movements, so you can use them anyway to get initiated by your body: it forgets your movement, and without your notice, replaces it with prerequisite movement if it knows it's training, or alternate capability for the same purpose if you are intentionally "moving the purpose" and not "moving the ability or growth"). Then, as your body has physical multiskill capabilities: for example, we can keep the wheel and talk - two quite separate chakra area activations, where communication and simple material positioning and control can occur at the same time; for example we talk when we walk. Now, from this: growing bigger complexes (such as nerve complexes, force points, especially in legs) and more, stronger nerves and synapses: those are parallel systems, compared to intellectual growth, which is rather linear and centralized. As those cells reach their higher chakras (and you and them learn infinities): your linear system consists again of these parallel systems. In your fractal, massively parallel body, networks of each functions, the "one thing you do", living, would be much more multidimensional: each dimension is an aspect of movement done in one part of the body, physically and consciously. From your sense organs, you should grow nerve systems to each body organ and below: while the eyes are located differently in relation to them, they can use ability to see and to gather some of this raw data, easily to grasp information from distance about or around them; so you open up your *material existence*: existence not only as one Mind, but as the whole fractal of it in the Body: Mind, still, will turn this into coherent topology if it's the Third Eye, or if it's the Immortal Element of You - it's like doing many things around you, considering many things around you. Where the Mind can show us fractals and imaginations, the body will add an accelerate factor to this: it contains a Fractal of Minds; despite your organs are having their separate, more or less definite functions, they are still separately active at the same time to fulfill your goal, and they grow their degree of self-resilience and a will to survive, serve, learn or grow. For the Fractal of Theories: give your body a basic experience of growth, so that it's Consciousness would grow by abstract growth - closing the combinatorics of this Essential Solution or Essential Problem by showing it different aspects and perhaps repetitions, it would learn to yearn for growth.

# From the Viking Tradition

From the Viking Tradition, the essence is quite skeptical in purity of intuition: the basic rules of direct strength, as well as development strength, comes naturally as some kind of basic belief or understanding of functioning of effort and experience. This is a very material world, where material effort is very intuitive: this purposefully aligns with our Ethereal experience.

This kind of safety provides the freedom of religions in the north: philosophical fear is very rare. So Viking tends to be a realist over quite a wide spectrum: this includes heavy efforts they take to change something about themselves and the surrounding realities, and preferred development of very realistic quality of senses, and positive survival despite of this skepticism.
