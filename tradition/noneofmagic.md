# It's none of Magic

Magic is not at all about Magic: it's not about the mystic secret, which provides the influence of ideal over the material without any means. We are not passive, but we are active in our pursuit for Health, for Ethics of Health.

"Sensitive", in my sense, is never attracted to reality-breaking, unnatural response, like a *wicked witch*:
- Sensitive person is a sensitive of their Material Senses: having practiced material attention of their physical realities, their Material Senses are purifying.
- Intuitively sensitive person responds to creative, intelligent realms of seeing this realm, which grows up into common experience of our reality, and forms an image, in senses, visualization methods or intellectual imagery and fantasy, which are all equal by our guide to spiritual uniqueness: Spiritual person is object to statistics and the exceptions, which prove the Theorem for Spiritual person, and it's uniquely exceptional for a Spiritual Person to be guided by matter, for objective or subjective reasons to build their sensitivity upon material and real-science, real-mathematical basis. Exceptional Scientist always fits the actual lines of the sensitives: an average sensitive rather has quoted Einstein by union of Authority with their Faith and Belief in God and Higher Realities of Lower Beings.

Materialist is not a so much lower being for a Spiritual Individual: despite they operate in lower dimension of mental axes, their intellectual and creative pursuits can, in Crafts and Arts, including the ex-Karmic Protection (karma is payment) and in-Karmic Creation (trade objects are objects to karma, both material and spiritual forming an enlightened government: Spiritual Person has reached decent levels of Constitution in Spiritual and Material Realms, and enjoys Civilized Cooperation).

We do not unite Religions, but we unite Philosophies: each might be doubting a lot, and each has given some answer to uncertanties: the best answer in Buddhism and Philosophies is called Void, it's the principle of Fool: you don't know. In this not knowing, where numerous causes and effects constitute a reality, which is free of ultimate truth and final judgement - thus arrive the Equal Rights of Good and Bad, where we do not know who is Right - we look an Empty View, which fits all.

Empty View is not rational. Ration has dimensions, which can be made from linear particles of space and function, drawing direct lines to ultimate infinities, zeroes and relations in finities: logical cube is such a direct line of repetition, and ethical framework with it's stable coordinate systems cannot get out of the "Box of God", a way where we do not measure our eternal situation in particulars.

What is our eternal situation? The eternal reality is Empty and Void: it does not contain any guaranteed reality for us. It Exists: our Ultimate Victory, the growth of Life and anything what comes Past, the "Past-Life", where we relate to ancestors. We measure, more by each second, day, year, but even more with every big experience such as looking back to long life: the past by it's outcomes in future, and what we could have previsioned. It takes the curve up, and pays for each thing in the past by over and over relating the value of our money.

We have to provide Constitutional Bridge through the Spiritual and Material essence of us: our left and right shoulder. Shoulders, while normally kept in free position a little towards the future, front of us, can assist in many structural systems of body - for example, heads wide apart form an easy system to connect hands and body so that we could lift and move our body easily with hands, typically for some time. From the "Anatomy and Physiology" book, I also got an impression that there are reengineering effects on the bones; where you should find these and other functions of your body bone structures. This is the holistic engineering of a human to change postures.

What connects the Spiritual and Material Realms:
- We are like in a movie, where Material and Spiritual realms co-stream one Body with it's activation of will and senses. We do not want to know their Sources, as the Sources are Mystical: to know the Sources, we learn that the Mind is Empty. We see this Illumination of the World coming through our senses: senses of body, mind, and intellectual and being activated by our will: activation by muscles, balance and intellectual solutions.
- Spiritual is more activated by their Mystical Vision of Reality Around them and Inside. They see the Irrational Dimensions, which has no single goals: for example, in Evolution and Survival, each skill is measured and there are no single skills to survive, but rather Empty Patterns not associated to any specific Law of Physics, Separately. Still there are Laws of Reality. The essence consists of many particular Motives.
- Material Realm appears Close, and while it's also Empty of Intent, the Intentions of the Objects are there and appear as singular, articulable functions generalized into some kind of engineering system of logic and reality. With movement, the physical matter can be altered, and with senses it can be seen.

Spiritual person does not see merely by senses: we sense by Mind. Properly, to be Spiritual is Higher, because Spirit is about Uniqueness: it involves Spiritual and Material on the First Level. Material sees what is Common: unlike the ever-expanding, the patterns are repeating slow enough to give us repetitions: stone age people, monkeys and even mice still reproduce, have families, eat and get rid of toxins, they breathe like us and think just like us about many particular things, such as carrying, getting there, finding a hidden spot or reaching their beloved one. Hardly can we see what is so distinct about human thinking.

Shamanism connects us all to prehistoric tribes, where we lived closeby like families: in Africa, Chinese could still be a neighbour to european: notice this neighbour was a Shaman.

This, by genetic memory: ChatGPT told it's scientific to think that all of us humans, by gene memory for adaption to certain traits means that we can easily adapt to Shamanistic tradition and ritual together - european Believer, Native American or Taoist might find their common tracks in cultivation as if they were family friends. When those families were neighbours, they practiced Shamanism and the practice dated back for long.

What was made in progress - Alchemy, Magic, Ritual, Religion and Metareligion / Science; in this we are connected by Future and not by Past: now as we can see each others, again, we feel like neighbors again, and learn so much of physical skills from each others, get so many childs, that we look very much the same.

Youth is sayd to be union in naive bliss; the youth is separation into rebelhood; and the old is enlightened mind - we have scientific enlightenment, collective event starting from times of enlightenment and recognition of scientific principles, Mind of the Collective Mind; we have religious enlightenment, individual event which has propagated, accumulatively like Series of Fibonaccy (typically doing that in Nature, being in symmetry of will) - each Satori of each Person puts them into Emptiness, which helps to Fullfill the Whole: the Whole is not even God, because God is Whole and Whole is projecting itself to Space and Time, and generations of Space of Focus of Time and Growth of it's Unity and Discrimination or Individuation of Times: in both space and time there is fractal of time and space; they become two-dimensional, space with two complete spatial dimensionalities and time with two complete temporal dimensionalities: this flow we see becomes such two-dimensional, with higher-order base or pre- dimensions, that potential field - imagine the Quantum Physics: reduction of superpositions especially as used in quantum computers to release the right or high-energy, preferred solution in either rational or previsionary hidden, Empty Space of Reason or Empty / Monkey Rationality, where we see only the forms funnily changing shapes: while we can repeat the Shapes and it looks so Funny; we cannot repeat the Essence. Notice our theory is not based on complicated sciences such as quantum physics, but we state in theorem about systems: it is either inherent or the system would find and unify superposition combinations on many layers of logic to work in union, and this is not important whether such "extramaterial" effect as instant cognition of multiple possibilities resolving into high-energy and equilibrum solution; rather, if it resolves over evolution of time, it would resonate so commonly that still seem to be the ultimate reality, dead reason; we can see so many metaphysical entities in possibility field - we are philosophical, open-minded, and notice we go through this space and time in patterns and repetitions, and those have no solid essence: in so many actual possibilities would they hint to any underlying reality; we are not specifically doing this or that thing, but we are doing something mystical and irrational: yet, by philosophy of Action, Tao, and philosophy of Perception, Zen, we are perfectly capable of doing this thing. We can relate life of Humankind with the one of Human - union, separation or rebellion, and the late union into higher unities: the realm of Superego in Old People, who are more Collective and Family Oriented, greedgiving.

For each exercise, we measure the highest purpose of Sensitive of Super performance with those whose material, essential roots are easy to track down - such as relying solely on Sound, and being efficient in presence of vibrations of bodies to know something about them. When we are sensitive to our surroundings: even our material sense data begins to be inseparable from Magic, it's base reason hard to explain as it's Empty: we can react properly to each sense, without separate causes and effects, but our Mind is to go Smooth; while the Material is of Repetitions, in Spiritual the Growth and Creativity form a single function (Growth of Body and Mind) with it's repetitive basis (Creativity of Body and Mind).

# It's Tradition

Traditionally, a Saint, Prophet, reincarnation of anything related to Soul of God or the Spirit of Land; of Father or Mother God, their Union or Separation into Different Personalities, their Fractal of Beings, where higher Angels are Godly and Godlike, often found their place in "Hierarchy of Gods".

Sanskrit Trinity: one Godly Essence is born into Three Gods. To associate this into original belief of each three religions: these are either Reincarnations or Oscillations (Avatars) of God. These are the frequencies, where harmony between Master or Major Octaves appears: as Infinite Scale and Finite Scale have harmonic vibration, the information, thus or from physical information and energy moving through Cone or Conus dimension of frequencies of Infinity: their simplest dimension is 1 to 2 relation, where heavy amount of Energy, movement patterns of Sound, Light and Information even-odd (with harmonic and disharmonic dimension, numbers, energies and matters either on same or different dimension); they reach to Time from Space Singular Hyperdimension - we see this flow of essence, energy and material form templates holographically from up to down, and we see many fundamental, unique properties such as the structure of chakras - functions efficiently positioned on these scales, for example head for higher-visionary, body for lower-visionary, hands for higher-motional and legs for lower-motional. "Visionary" means Body does not move much, but keeps it's structure; and Head does not resolve each particular case, but common patterns and unique, general variables - to ask for cake does not mean to ask for every particular action like cooking and farming, but one single question is empty of this matter of fact; we do not discuss each particular reason and effect of eating, digestion and energy, but we know this for single, empty purpose and reason: to exchange energy, associated to eating.

Zen of Present Moment is to let go of the Present Moment as it worries you: you cannot understand the Present Moment, nor it's meaning and position in your life; it burns you out that with each explanation, hint into unfolding of the actual meanings, where meaning is vibrant and alive in the past - dimensions and values of meanings, either good and bad, live in past as well as they live in the present; in our estimations, they are moving in the future.

There is the two-dimensional butterfly effect: we produce butterfly effect affecting each reality behind the value as we re-evaluate it, and the reality is changing as we understand it; we change, in butterfly effect, as the reality is adapting to our new value. In around the moment, instead of Time, we have complex Space: many equal possibilities. Zen is Empty and Void of particulars: each of those is solid and we see, in each of them some common scales appear: their internal space is fractal of local coordinates, but frequential oscillation f means they have common directions in Time: with some function uniting these Space and Time, each possibility has a direction to move forward, and directions of obstacles: Philosophy aligns with Science, and this Zen is Born, when our Reality is Free of Particulars. We do not know whether this lover would betray our love and let us go, or make our love tired so that we cannot stay, or we would find new and new, fresh reasons to stay aligned and resolve this Emptiness and Void: our material body, our mental spirit and activities, for Man and Woman, would they not resolve into one frequent body of physical union, and so many mental layers of physical and mental unions, of cooperational union in this "society of two": as Confucius said, Family is the basis for Society, for Civilization.

In presence, in Butterfly effect of Ourselves and Realities, which both try to recognize the actual, final state of each: logic eliminates itself, causes and effects vanish, and instead the logic is starting to break and rejuvenate the reality: to find out what can actually happen.
