# Mundanity of Matters

Typically, in a general day, especially in city:
- We are doing rounds of simple activities, such as walking, opening doors, giving weightless things to others or receiving them. We eat, sleep, try to remain comfort on our bed.
- Per a day or week, even month, we are obligued for one act of more strength - like carrying things from inside to a car.
- City workers, as well, *do not* practice such killing behaviors as lifting especially heavy things, for many times: rather, each heavier thing is contributed by a machine.

The long-term tiredness, out of all things cultivated into being tired of life, is our extra effort.

For this, training heavily ruins your exercise often: as you have heavy weights, you do it for very limited time, and it's hard to focus on goal. Once you got it, similar strength does not qualify so well in normal flow of life.

From those 99% of time, where the steady flow of weak force is expected, we wash the dishes, go to toilet, bring letters from post office or just bring them in. We still get tired: generally, we feel very weak signals of various battery underloads, and we remain in uncomfortable situation of preparing and relaxing - this turns into seeing our life is too short, lacking the exponent factors.

Exercise with weak pressure, wide variety of movements, often less symmetries of a moment; a steady flow of low-intensity movements in complex imaginary space. Each daily activity should be noticed and what becomes tired, exercised; movements from favourite people, contra and archetypes of you on TV screen, should be followed in dance, created by their stars: expect them using what they got, with expression which convinces them in this experience they have.

This evokes: your exercise will get local muscle groups, batteries etc. tired, where the global energy remains; you can switch exercises to stress only the global batteries with stimulation to growth; you can repeat it locally to go through various layers, phases and force distributions of muscles. You use your postures: to train same movement in various postures, or to keep similar posture longer by switching to alternatives.

Over time, you target to have back-up muscles to live when you are tired. You train for pain, so that when the qualities, positives of a pain remain the same, it's not stressful.

You train bones: you repeat weak movements, which crack bones, where the initial crack becomes fluid. Similarly, the base meridians: front-back, left-right, up-down, as well as more complex views to this conception: the centers and near-extremes are interesting parts to train, where the centers might not have a crack, but they do not have fluid movement. Overcoming these cracks makes your movement fluid and free.

Practice introverted, close-to-body, as well as extroverted, apart-from-body movements; so that you fit with more people, still interact with exteriour zone.
