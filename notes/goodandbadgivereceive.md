# Good and Bad - to Give and to Receive

Good and bad, better and worse, the echos of our initial understanding: each power in the Universe could be explained by those, but only if you don't believe in them.

## Giving and Receiving

I talk about Constitutional law - I am not meaning a process of giving and receiving in any straightforward way as I do not have a central "Zero" point in my logic, a point where things gain value.

In Complex of Good and Bad, one can see various fallacies coming from presence of these words:
- Your integrated, Empty and Void system of growth and mutual understanding is split into pieces of giving and receiving.
- One thing or person better or worse than another is seen as a little part accumulating into the whole; each part accumulates towards it's direction.
- Many mistakes in the understanding of Good themselves are translated by liars paradox - to avoid their costly biases, good and bad have to be hidden: they have to be hidden for people have Understanding of Good and Bad, coming from their genesis.

## Causality of Giving and Receiving

As Spiritual People, we create a complex system of giving and receiving, where we see the following balance:
- The Whole is the Position actor, where the highest accumulated gain becomes from the Presence of the Whole in our Minds and Actions. We accumulate the part of the sum, which is already bigger than our Whole.
- The Part is the Negation actor, where the lowest gains would break out otherwise functioning system; each loss can be a fatal loss, rendering a person off from all their accumulation of the karma.

So our Position energy is to accumulate the expanding, ever-lasting Wholeness and Holity; our Negation energy is to avoind the complete breakage at any point of the system:
- For the whole, it's positive direction is accumulative, so each gain produces numerous gains, when measured on position accumulation scale. Science, for example, tends to be as strong as it's strongest part - it's accumulative.
- For the parts, their negative direction is decumulative, so each loss such as death will create a complex networks of negative accumulation. The chain, for example, tends to be as strong as it's weakest part - it's deccumulative.
- So the Science is Position, where the Chain is Negation, in this sense, by the nature of their energies; to free or to prison one thing, for example your boat is free by the Science, still prisoned to it's standing position with Chains: once the Science develops, it can do so in a single point; once the Chain breaks, it can do so in a single point.

## Win-Win-Win strategy

It is:
- One side wins.
- The other side wins.
- Their gains are growing through fluctuations with the whole.

This 3W (three-we) strategy then, can lose one or two wins, but the remaining two or one wins can still gain.

Let's call those directions left, right and up:
- I use the Chakra notation in the following way: back-front is the strongest, representing the Whole; left-right is the weakest, representing the People; up-down is the middle scale, representing also where we measure the interaction. So we generalize the complex fractal of three dimensions into the central dimension X (up-down), where the material dimension left-right or Z, and the spiritual dimension back-front or Y, still average into the X - as we reduce dimensionality to one, which is most common thing to do with actual multiple dimensions, we get the X scale.

## Condition of Constitution

Constitution is kind of Unconditional: as a representative of the Higher Force, we can speak of Constitutional Laws; we use their basic formulations, turn them to mathematical theorems and calculate - once the police and the lawmakers run with lower constitution than ours, remaining in authority and claiming their directions, now they turn into *Good People* - they need to be Good, so they Act, they need to Know, so they Talk, and they need to Understand, so they Guess; the fatal paradox comes from not being Good - they were Born Good, this is the Paradox. So the police lets you karmically fuck themselves in this instance, and you are like a gangster: your solutions to constitutional laws start to generate earnings, and "cityzenship" you talk of, is not theirs any more.

Constitional gain is not unidirectional, i.e. composed of two directions: it's bidirectional, i.e. the directions do not exist as they go through integrative formulaes. You are "cityzen", part of this fluctuation.

If you are minority, it's a fragile ground, easy to break (read Nassir Taleb for definitions of this word) - once one is not flowing freely in this process of gain and receive, the whole turns into breakage.

You start from Good Position, as you are Child of Goodness, Child of Democracy, a person with non-individualized muscle: you measure a common ground for this wisdom, and each person being or doing it is giving (and receiving), while the others are merely receiving.

Zero-sum: you think each solution is balanced, as in Conservation of Energy law - once you saw it in a materialist aspect, you thought they are ideal yin and yang; the Yang, the Spirit, only gives; the Yin, the Matter, only receives.

This position of Goodness comes from your Ancestors:
- Everybody helped the Saints, the Beggars, the Enlightened - Nations accumulated this purpose and they had, then, *a priori* cityzenship; you, reflecting their Good position, see it is good and you behave, as if Spiritual is not a Business Woman of America - somehow miracuously, you assume that people like you are still people, still cityzens, still paying taxes. For a Spiritual person, they do not receive this call into their Minds: they see no giving at all, it's not enough to go to forest, build your little temple in a random place and start praying (or meditating); the Rice would not appear - instead a policeman comes and explains, that the owner of this forest themselves did a good work.
- We see that the Good is not measuring Good and Bad, but rather the direct plate of logic, where predeterminated constants appear - for example, these days where Spiritual people are not helped by people, by heavy money and amount, the debunkers still talk, like their ancestors, a loss they would get from False Spirituality; moreover, the many mistakes of mislead followers, beginners or betrayers of the principle are generalized to their teachers: good and valid scientific works, such as Taodejing. Scientific means they do not fail the reason.
- The very same sceptics who debunked, then sent away, made into homeless, demonized the spiritual people - they want to have calm arguments, they imagine themselves like on an edge of a big scientific discovery once they meet the spiritual people; they imagine money so big that they go mad.

This madness in people of this chance - this comes from undeservance, from feelings of their past. The past people, helping out each buddha, each prophet, each blesser and saint, had gains of this: in these times now, one should not expect the gain, still they imagine what they could be left out of - in this synergy, they imagine, the holistic goal, one would get those gains and give them back to social goodness, who really wanted to help a *true saint*.

What this goodness has to do with capitalism, is hard to imagine: you go spiritual, into seek of higher society, but people are still running around and telling you their grandmother gave something to saint in the forest; the scientist still struggle with how much they gave wrongly if you were fake. None of this is true.

Constitutional good and bad, then, is:
- In constitution, by following it's rules, you *Give*.
- In constitution, by having it's rights, you *Receive*.

People want to measure, how much they give and receive; who gets too much, such as somebody messing with the markets and giving free their excesses - they try to balance this in positive and negative ways.

I want to say: without not measuring in the point of Zero frequency, but with each chakra, I must keep going with these low frequencies they measure into these terms of good and bad; I must separate, discriminate and find my position, the capitalist business, in the high frequencies where they flatten the picture into Good and Bad.

Spiritual people are none of non-rationalist: the giving and receiving, bad and good, also hold in these higher frequencies: once you overcome good and bad, you can see good and bad in things.

## Taste of One

Constitution, and our Spiritual Highs, are not giving and receiving - through challenges, sacrifices, synchronicities and blissful states of Spirit, we go this path and none of us can make mistakes; we can see how the Constitution floats. We generate more goods, and there is abundance - what we created in excess, we give to those in colors of the perfect needs; accumulation equally treats good and bad - accumulation of bad is not as summing, as direct giving, but by highening this principle, and highening is not into the low, such as giving the gun to a wrong man, with perfect rights. Accumulation of good, then, is so big that it leaves this accumulation of bad into shadows: we are not lost, in pains and suffering, where the bad receives, because we are somewhat different; we are given less, but we gain more. The people measure this: they try to give less and less, so that you would gain like them, to balance the good and bad in society of equality, brotherhood and love.

Once this perfect flow is divided into good and bad:
- The people follow the consitution half time, and try to relax and earn back the other half; they want to earn back this all. In zero-sum game, you are always raising - the capitalist system works like evolution -; but others want to earn back, and the evolutionary lessons are again replaced with trial and error - you fall to the initial position.
- The people are cityzens: you want to raise by following the constitution, and you do not give a damn of this statistical rich and poor, the undeserved ratios - they are locally efficient, globally earning and lifting, and you rather need to progress than to catch this other man, to establish good and bad between you and him.

When one man loses, the other man runs there telling he is the enemy: now he won. But he made nothing.

When one creates fruitful environment, where things go, the people run there to succeed from the new qualities of the environment, as they were people, too - they might not have been, in terms of real money, the people for you. They measure those who made sacrifice, see their losses; they see deep, hidden meanings in loss of those who work; every moment you work, they see your loss, and every moment you have not paid, they see the reason. There, in this little oasis, among all the suffering and work for gain, the sacrifice and work for high gains - there appear here and there, things and pleasures; these things and pleasure are measured as good: people who got the house, car and money at this moment, are seen as in evolutionary phase of good - somehow, they deserved those things; somehow, you need to smile, to separate them from bad people who are currenly in process of duty. These things are moving around and their movement needs to be balanced; you see in the process: the good people are also balancing good and bad in them, they are near zero-point and get even lower to be equal to others: they run away with these good things.

You see the Environment needs to be like Sun: you are sitting and taking the Light.

In actual reality, each environment fails fast if the Good and Bad are measured - people, who give away by following the constitutional laws, and get back by getting the tax service, and talk how cityzen they are so to balance this, to enter the oasis, and even to leave it when it fails, with heavy critique. You see those people with their smiles of Goodness, turning your signs into their real, material meanings: they are sitting like Scientists, Saints and Rich men, and each of them has a hat: the hat in put in front of them, people have to throw money there, and this money is so good that it proves them to be good people.
