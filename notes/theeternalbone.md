# The Eternal Bone

Bones, in my view from all sources, including my body - and especially hinted in Taoism, where you can look for so many successes. So, here, I have drawn inspiration from Taoism and my own late exercise.

The movement of body is most generally interplay of two structures or forces:
- The muscles (and flesh)
- The bones

I call the forces for each movement muscles: saying that if I gather this movement, I got this muscle. This, because muscle is not necessarily a whole muscle, but can be certain tissue inside - just training one muscle is not equal to training itself and it's area completely for each movement: the exercise is carried to other movements in complex patterns.

I also call the flexible and weak bone-like structures bones, a structure.

As in the machine: structure and the motors or engines.

Frequenctially, it's like this:
- Bones are Earth frequency, Yin or minus infinity. They keep you rooted.
- Muscles and flesh are Heaven frequency, Yang or plus infinity. They keep you moving on.

Which is based on Taoism.

Opposites of Tao come in 4, and not 2; so lets do what I call "r switch" on my letters, or ponegate (where it turns around):
- Bones and bonelike structures, also, are related to "immortality": the mortal periods of our life are replace by sustained stability. This comes from their yin flexibility and yang resiliance.
- Muscles and flesh, then, represent the yang: they are the active force over this passive flow. This yang kind is not yang, because bones also keep angle in infinity.

Bones:
- Exercise of bone crack will slowly create flexibility; especially in you simple movements, if you ustilize more possibilities to move (such as moving your palm right left and right, doing rotations, not doing them with rotation angles of your hand), you become more flexible. Bone training then, thus bones, provide with flexibility.
- Bones are also responsible on locks: they can turn off any flexibility, which is close to what they are initially doing. To avoid muscle tension, we stand on locks of our bones, and when we have to keep glass in our hand, we like to move it into bone lock and not keep it up with muscles.

This is what resistance and resiliance we call "immortality" (not because it brings there, but because it's a seed ability; it's making you *more* immortal and not immortal, which is achievable): to stand still you have to stand when the world is moving; as the world moves, it requires you to be flexible.

Think of this: as you create this body, keeping in mind the metaphors, which appear; it inspires your higher systems as well, being the force; and you can see this materially: for any person, who is standing in their position, such as home, work, or their eternal journey of Mind and Bodies, they basically need to stand "like soldiers" - in cues, waiting positions or watching their child, they have to stand; in workplace - at least they need to sit. This context for your active movement is work of bones - and it fractals up into the meanings of your life. Each standing position needs many stands, as well as development of this brain for stands actually needs this bone thinking.

Notice you do with bones as you do with muscles; you use fractal powers:
- Bones, as well: if you train it, you get the fractal of theories. While you train you hand bones more flexible, slowly the "energy" will spread through your body and in course of exercise cycles, all the other bones become more flexible. This is why you should, in parallel to more generic process, develop some features especially well: for example, if you spend several years for hands, they become enough focused strength to become a master for your body to learn. Your hands have experienced all this, and started the seed production of each element.
- Also, the bones grow bigger.

Well, you can read Mantak Chia for argumentations about the bones, as well as other Masters related to Taoist Alchemy, such as Neidan.

The smoothness of body without cracks also creates the real speed - while you are not "speeding up" in way to ruin your cause, your are also not "slowing down" in a way you do not need. This is not a major effect, for example for hands - it develops slowly and in the beginning, you just notice a slight speedup, which does not use additional energy nor provide additional risks. Direct speed training makes it *very fast*, but there remain hit-like qualities - you are long time able for mostly these precise moves. Training up the flexibility is a holistic way in regards to movement scope, as it speeds up every single movement, and (especially) the whole.
- This also adds to complexity of your movement.
- Most of things you are stuck with are actually about this - you live more moves, which means, longer.

# Brain bones and flesh bones

Notice the effect of training bones does not necessarily spread through the bones, but through the bone support systems as well - specific sensations might spread through areas, which seem to contain but a muscle.

As brain cracks along with your bones - also the bone control (and they have to do a lot, in control of your borders, locks and releases of them; as well as movement of the lock blocks, where something inside moves, often not materially but through irrational positions - it keeps the whole movement ability slightly in one or another direction, but locks itself). So, in brain, as it develops bone control, all such ability will be centralized, adding to much more precise angles you get to the future.
