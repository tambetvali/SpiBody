# Energy Acceptance Training

Sometimes, as you stand up after meditation or after sitting and contemplating, you might have started kind of wave into your life.

This can come in as an energy feeling, while your body is recalibrating. If you have not trained for this, you might start to doubt, whether it's energy; also it can be Positive or Negative.

It might be untrained effect: that you have to sit down again, for a moment to recover; or you fear losing the coordination and equilibrium. Have a strong intent to train in regards to this energy, or in regards to your body parts not to become dead - such as legs unmovable after you have been sitting down. The realignation you feel on grand scale: as you set your intent to train, to get aquintained with this, as well as you have some intent to stand up and move very firmly, the feeling can grow into actual feeling of energy.

Meditation, naturally, is going to realign your life - your body, then, will go through realignment, which would close the energy cycle.
