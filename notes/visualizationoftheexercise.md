# Visualizing the Exercise Space

When you visualize an exercise, you are interested:
- In nature of the exercise, and perhaps it's relative or absolute count.
- Of the effect of these exercises.

Different aspects of timeline could show:
- Repetition of physical movement, also symbolics of colors for intents and sensations.
- Co-time, which uses this animation time to either show accumulated, linearized effect of these exercises, such as accompanying the exercise with force: spreading red color could show how the force spreads from the exercise in months and years, starting from slowdown then reacing speedup to show the rest of the life. Slowdown part might start from one particular session, as well as particular sessions might blend in into several starts in fractal space - in this particular session in the beginning, you get tired, and this might map to each instance you initially get tired; at the end, while you watch repeated movement of a hand, you see the energy spreading through the fractal space of repeated exercise - you see energies appearing slowly, in colors and symbols, and distributing through the body.

We can use computer simulation to show extended amounts of information, so that we can choose exercises and understand their effects, getting further from the rigid frameworks - into liberation, the liberal thought we participiate in Spiritualism, along with what we learn from masters of the old and our fellow students today.
