# Introverted and extraverted - open and close muscle.

Introverts keep their hands close to body, all the parts close as they move. They are very good in alone activities, and they do not take much space, as well they can pass people very easily. All these positions evoke feelings of shame - intro, is kind of "to the ground", and material chakras evoke shame. This shame needs to be trained away: train each of your intropositions, train also lying on bed, sitting on chair, and any comfortable or solitude position you have, or which expresses comfort coming from inside or solitude. Comfort positions, unless you train them, get less comforted - losing power, you start feeling each position uncomfortable and the small local movements to fix them, without training, does not help. Exercise non-comfort positions: lie on bed, sit on chair, in non-comfort position and enjoy the little force coming from this, grow it.

Extraverts keept their hands away from body, and movements reach away from them. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci are good examples: what they do with their hands, is most extraverted of the world, as it is ought to carry a message; picture drawn on table, close to you, is then indeed an introvert picture. Open positions create open muscles, and those are very good for work in general, and work together with other people - you pass things, shake hands, and move around. Walking, you can keep legs further apart.
