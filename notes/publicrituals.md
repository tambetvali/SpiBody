# Public Rituals

Notice the connections of Chakras:

***Root Chakra***: this is connected to Shamanism. Physical magic, the tradition of physical rituals, is what connects us to Animal Kingdom.

***Crown Chakra***: this is connected to Equality of Paradigms, not mere following of Higher Paradigm after the Lower Paradigm, as in Apocalypsis for the Lower Realms. Universe contains multiple very advanced paradigms of genes in alien races and genesis of their culture and be. Crown Chakra connects us to aliens, which you can see as real (as in Star Seed base beliefs) or as imaginary (as in fiction of Isaac Asimov, where I suggest the "Mage").

Root Chakra, notice, connects the Animal Kingdoms, but also the physical matter - known, in Hermetics, as elementals. You can think: from our being to our cells, to very basic organisms, which behave like matter in homeostasis, one can see that we might give advancement to material sensations, not be a start of any sensation: life, if merely artificial, would appear as random structure of complex matter, and not share the feelings so close to the matter.
 - Below the Root Chakra, to the legs, is the matter: for this, even our "material structures" are accelerated forms, not based on natural choice and entropy.

Imagine your sensations of thunder rain, of volcanoe, of beauty of another planet or the sky - has nothing to do with the natural forces inside. Breath deeply, calmly, and notice the *neutral* view to the life in those emotions - rather than thinking, what a Thunder or Volcanoe gives to us, you enjoy the natural force inside, still working for the human environment. The awe is not a human-centric emotion, but resonates to very different forces, either material or spiritual, lower or higher than us (Z or Y planes not on X); in these senses there is something characteristic to those natural forces.

***Solar Plexus***: this connects us to humans and human angels or humanoid aliens first, and to other unities. We live in the world starting from similarities.
- **Solar Plexus** is the Power, associated with Will.
- **Third Eye** is the corresponding Control, associated with Thought.
- This, in the system where **Heart** and **Crown** form similar function: God is guiding the Myriad Creatures through their innumerous paths; and awaken God in you grows a nerve cell to the Almighty God.
 - As well, **Root** and **Throat**, sometimes **Sacral Chakra**, form the **Nature** and **Science**.

This fractal of chakras, times and associated guilds is intentionally containing some chaotic elements: in my theory, infinity never ends, which means it never yields to complete order; three and four are not equal nor primes to each other. You have to be free minded to continue the fractal in your imaginations, to form a complex living system.

# Animals and Aliens

Animals are:
- our Past.
- our Home Land.
- our Blood Relatives.

Aliens are:
- our Future.
- our Creation of Us (we are approaching Stars).
- desire to mix blood.
