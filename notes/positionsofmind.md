# Positions of Mind

The body has positions - the case that you can do it sitting, does not means you can do it standing, especially with the same skills. This creates a landscape you move on.

## Positions of Mind

Each body position needs to have some training aligned with each position of the parts, you are in a system to find corners and metasynapses, the "opposites" or nearby points to be trained to reach closer to continuous trained area, and the "combinators", which relates all the positions of one to all the positions of another.

Well it is:

I train my senses to sense the space around me, best as I can, without necessarily looking.

My exercise is walking the street - objects, people, dogs and children - and avoid them while I am looking backwards.

When I am looking backwards over left shoulder, people coming from right are hidden; backwards over right shoulder, people coming from left are hidden.

Why I don't just close my eyes? Simply because I want to be more or less sure where I am: I sense 20-40 cm so easily, but two meters with hardship and the surrounding, as a coloured scene, only sometimes with some flash of something already resembling either higher sense or a particular mix of memory, knowledge of space, and all the gravity, light and heat, and vibration or air pressure aware parts of my body; if I have any abilities already using quantum effects, indeed the synchronization with these must be common to humans - maybe in how the body relates to quantum dimensions or space and activity does influence some effects on the nerves, or some quantum patterns are directly observed.
- There are numerous shapes for nerves for measuring each effect of those, and as they are the basic fields or properties we also use in physics - for example, electricity of the body as a controlled force for certain purposes -; these shapes must relate to more complex patterns, which might convey all kinds of information fields.
- Please do not mind your particular abilities and powers: be happy if your exercise involves that each participiant has to play a music instrument or have noise-making digital device in their hand, with a loudspeaker; in all terms: grasp a better understanding of your surroundings with all the senses. In my particular case, "sensitive" is a very open word with connotations of either they are more sensitive to things, or they have some additional senses; I do not know and I do not want to know is a honest answer.

Why we are then not superstitious, if sensitives are so sensitive and know some truth:
- We do not represent a clear distinction between poetic expression and literal truth, rather we convey a deeper meaning in our words. Sensible words can be measured for their particular purposes, and the experience can be gently assimilated; as the reality is Void, we do not know why they have this sense expression. On the other hand, we should use more common language: express the material thing with your material body and voice, spiritual thing with accomplied spiritual vibration, and assimilate that when people contemplate their experience, even in the future they beome aware of things they did not see back then - memory keeps a very magic pattern in sense that as your consciousness grows, with new patterns, you notice them also in the past; this is a strong effect that reflecting back, the qualities of senses will get sharper and you use your new qualities of processing the imagery with the actual datums of the old.
- Measure the physical world: mental world is nothing in itself but a more long-term and wider-range view, encompassing far more people to grasp the societies, civilizations and each contact to come in it's modest potential. What we give and receive comes slowly visible in the fruits of our physical interaction and the actual use of carried information.
- Stay calm, without fears and hopes. A king of heaven does not bring you the heaven nor would the king of hell bring you the hell itself: each is at the far journey, living from what they have; we just give and receive and we do not expect - Zen is to free yourself from expectations, and Tao is to prepare for the Changes; Kung Fu sounds like Confucius, but is maybe the solid grasp of any given reality: on higher level, yet it's yin to the even higher and that of the history.

### Muscle of Mind

I see: as I train or relax, turn on or exercise each position where I have the mental mind: having sharp vision in one body position still needs training in the other one; for example, if I walk some time looking over one shoulder, I can not keep so sharp sense each time I switch to another; it needs a warm up.

The exprience sounds so metaphysical, but feels like a muscle:
- Suddenly, I need deep sensitive breathing as I am tired.
- Muscle-like feeling of something, which is tired into pain from the repetition or stable use.
- All the symptoms of muscles getting tired; so that I feel they start to grow some time - perhaps I learn a special repetition or exercise I can practice at home, with "weights", as the training itself is sometimes more creative than practice: this practice is an exercise, one I cannot practice at home.

What I want to achieve? I don't know is it vision or neglection of the future, or an experience from the past; are there patterns in more easily known or direct images of that which is known more hardly (/ hardly known). I want an unconscious life, where the patterns of solutions have lost their meanings into void; where I still walk into light, turning my past into the light - each seed I gave and perhaps I saw can be given the nutrition and support.

This means you could train sensitivity in specific postures where it's simpler, to look like a Medievial Sorcerer; or use more general training of specific parts of body, but also differentiating mental, bodily, movement and energy functions so that you are not moving necessarily, or doing a particular sequence of moves, but you can stand still or remain your positions and flows, while the magic is operating: this is called a Wind, whereas each particular position in particular magic is element of Earth; then Water would grow emotion to it and Fire would express passion towards it; while Space would start it invisibly coming closer. What is Metal? Perhaps metal is bones, because the bones to keep you in reality or to move it watch, from yin, and face the space in which you are moving: yang, in this particular case. Where the bones keep your structured Vehicle, even more than skin or body, the space is the direction or intent of this Vehicle. In such case, two elements of fifth nature could be resembled in Zen and Tao, because movement in Space and Eternity reminds of what is felt as Absolutely Stable in the Presence - the Metal, slowly, builds an Empire; and what is Heaven but the next of Empire, it's the ultimate goal of each Empire for the future melt and union, loss and the victory. It's an Epic Song.

Sense of Surroundings:
- You have taste, hearing of sound and vision of eyes; alltogether making sense of 360 degrees.
- You have such complexes and patterns that you start to imagine of supernaturality; this is the feeling of inertia as your muscle would progress: once you slow down, it becomes habitual, but still valueable; you connect it again with people and the nature, each being enlightened from the beginning - the patterns you enstrenghtened, they appear in slow progress and guide people ultimately, towards mental death or enlightenment; towards the rise or the fall; each fall most strongly confronts even more basic and accessible laws of nature, where the law heads up - it's also present that the law fails, where the law exists, but heads down; the reality accelerates your rise or fall: but the fall more often meets a solid obstacle than the rise, and an obstacle for the rise more often gives a lesson to balance and purify the Rise into the Golden Middle of Your own Path: where you are but a piece.

What to do with this information:
- Sit in your more sensitive positions, try positions and movements of senses; for example sound reflections might enlighten the surroundings. You want to sense what you can, remember what you can, and imply what you can - this super naturality can resemble supernaturality; but do not believe the prisons of reality would fall: despite, your inner freedom finds a way in the labyrinths associated, an enlightened way as the prison is empty, it's neither prison nor is it a freedom; freedom is not outside, but within you: Taoist practice to it is to Surrender, where the Way exists and opens.
 - Practice repeatedly in the same position, half time.
- Move into least and less sensitive positions, and try to have your senses here as well.
 - Practice in different, unique positions, looking for the same skill.

 Here, it's like Christ sharing the bread:
 - We take the whole and cut it into two halves.
 - Two halves are both the whole, none of them is half: you do your whole exercise.

In time you move from one center to another - hands for 3 years, legs for three years, hands for three months, legs for three months; you learn a stable and solid movement of your physical attention. With effortless exercise, you don't get your hands really tired in minutes, hours or days - it takes weeks, months and years. You have time also for times in the fractal - if you take each position 3 years, take all positions of this time into 3 years as well, which might contain the whole cycle also in weeks of the same direction.

While this is a scenario, notice all the exceptions and deeply discussed things:
- You can learn traditional practices, as well as unique findouts of special talents and Masers, and either use mine only philosophically or mix these things.

Why one whole can be divided into many wholes?
- Because the purpose of having life or day exactly that long is not to consume all your energy in one day or one lifetime; the purpose is that you can live several lifetimes in this time. You do not follow a perfection, which leaves you just with one "siddhi" (as it would become truly miraculous for you); you see this time you have for exercise is random, shorter or longer, and rather than thinking it's for one complete exercise, you think half or quarter of this time is as good, as random chance to get: so you build a fractal in each direction to reflect reality with this intent, and you get a balanced willpower; each part of this whole will multiply each and even the miracle of the single part is miracle or a siddhi only compared to the other parts, not in the absolute scale - each supports each and none dies, this is your miracle of living creature or being, a chance to be a human, a conscious being you are.

## Visualization of Chakras

Call the head chakras Communication Z, the decceleration or coming from under the zero; Vision X, the station or static presence; Crown Y, the acceleration or genesis from the Future and our idealized thought, absolute and everlasting union of truth (think of Einstein's seek for "United Theory" as well as how Religion finds Common Ethics, where it's precessors mostly found ethical end for each single story, seen as separate enigma by story-tellers; from myriad of single things, matter, the metasingular essence appeared, the spirit or soul).

Call the body chakras Synchronization / Heart (E, the Infinite); Self or Ego / Solar Plexus (A, the Finite); Spirits of the Self / Emotion (A, the finitely divided); Particles of the Matter / Matters or Roots chakra (I, the infinitely divided, sub-zero particles of our soul, enightened into families and tribes and materials aspects of the civilizations).

Now create a topology mix:
- E: Heart
- Y: Crown
- A: Solar Plexus (the Unity, Self)
- X: Vision
- O: Emotion
- Z: Throat, Communication
- I: Root, the Material World

Resonances of Body and Mind are now attuned.

You get two Matrixes: 3\*3 Matrix and 4\*4 Matrix. You resolve them into a grid. Interesting 3*4 matrix of cross combination is actually what you need: seen as X and Y axe, how each of these combinations form a Matrix of Reality, to be your fractal head to draw imaginations of particular potentials?

You see your Self: Vision of you is made from Emotions and guided towards Unity.

You see the Crown: Guided by Heart, you see each person as Unique identity.

You see the Crowd, the Communication Chakra: led by Emotion, it's organizing the Material World as it's substance.

You might miss the Female Principle: The Top is connected to the Bottom. In infinity, you see how the outcomes merge into the incomes, what was a rhythym from past to future becomes an unfolding, a pattern where the Mind illuminates the Matter: through it's non-linear movement, our foundational margins are passed, ideals conceived. Evolution converges here and remains into higher oscillations of Chaos, of the Unknown Margins into your Primary Concern. The reality is in eternity, and each past is a loan to the future: indeed, we progress and we create, we do not remain. I use X with rounds-out at each external top of the letter, a beautified Z, X, Y inside, to show the Female Principle: it's most concerned about how the beginnings and ends meet, the infinity, not the finity of a man, who constructs upwards from the details. In a Female, then, the Chakras might appear outwardly present. Female and Male principle, in 1/3 relations, is said to exist in Man and a Woman, which is central in Taoism, Hermeticism and Buddhism or Hinduism. A jewish person might agree on Cabbalistic basis: Cabbala, as much as it's presented to us, is in agreeance with the Eastern Systems, where orthodox jews might question things like eternal reincarnation: I say it's confusing the fractal with it's fractal head, a topology of the reality with it's ever-expanding hologram or holotrope (the "center" is seen in the line, where warming-up effect of entropy and it's resolution is removed, as seen by other kind of symmetry - do not think that conservation of matter would hold less; rather, it's information space becomes more fine-grained, more energetic).

The Heart:
- To the Society, it creates one whole out from many Unique Paths; where you see your complex pattern resolving like a linear line. Thus, this is material assistant of the Chrown, unites some complex into the Self for it's presence in it's Uniqueness or many axes. From our United Cause or Spirit, need for unique everlasting "Embodiments" exist right into this common principle; each Crown is an unique point in a hyperspace then, and God is the projection of this whole Holotrope: question, whether principle of Union like God comes from unity of the many, or singularity of the whole; rather, the energy in lower and higher frequencies vibrate along. For many reasons, in the center of these points appears the point from Higher Octave: becoming much like our own oscillation, the principle of God Above, would create an interference into God Below, and as much as the basic laws are the same ("as Above, so Below"), this God Below would take a straight line to eternity, teaching others. Principle of Buddha, then, would be taking the *whole linear infinity* as a path of One Lifetime, so the Buddha Gautama would reflect a principle a God rather passes through all His Lifetimes, for a Solid Experience: the Time is Expanding, so is Space, but it's into the granularity of information, not the mass of it, which is constraint of Thermodynamics.
- To your Self, the Heart responds each person Uniquely, becoming a Crown of your body. Unique Stories appear, and it starts to resonate the essence, which brings them together. Solar Plexus might fall into competition, superior power of will and thought: Heart brings a *meaning* into differences of our ranks and incomes, looking a harmony where everybody is different, still alive and "well eaten" in their part, for it's also forgiving.
- To your Blood, the Heart is one rhythym - a solid axe of the whole -, paradoxically getting each red and white cell where it belongs - by this solid rhythym, and some events, the Heart gets everything where it belongs, in uniqueness of each cell.

This was the first row and column of our grid: imagine the connection of brain and body knows it's ways to combine, as they can create many different systems of synapses. For example, in hand, in the middle part I see square matrix: in training, I actually had a later vision of one appearing.

Matrix: it keeps complex realities in linear pace, where they turn, but feel going forward: turning without turning; where each sense and liberation, surrender, gets you closer to this (hyper)linear feeling of still going straight.

## Matrix of Positions

Matrix, by it's multiplication as a function, finds every relative combination between two things - let's call them *inner* and *outer*.

For example, if you want to train your hand (palm) to know each position in relation to your body and arms, you got a combinator of two inner axes:
- Each position of the Palm must be fractally known: the stupid, robust, central positions where you train the force (extra effort) and the smaller, more intelligent moves where you need firmness in each. Where the body got imbalance, you follow it to form a balance; where you life creates imbalance, you have to do with it: the balance of your system is also relative to your ecosystem by effort and need; you learn a specific style with it's inner balance: your own style. You try to break in to and break out of your style: what has advantage, you train stronger (exercise your strengths), but which has disadvantage, you train more (exercise you weaknesses and strengths). This way, each part of the fractal has it's proper position - is this part of the higher or lower structure.
 - "Peace hand" with all fingers straight upwards, palm in direction of will; "War hand" with all fingers closed: despite your palm, your full hand itself also knows these basic positions as it's own movement; you could train these positions harder and stronger, for they use the energy of fractal heads; with your four fingers in two couples like yin and yang, forming third couple like tao - or reflecting, by unity of three, a Christian trinity; of two couples, to walk on separately, is the hardes: your body is not a system of coordinates in 3D space, but it's a physical instrument and a fractal with multiplicity of levels, where it's balance and equilibrium is that fractal head (biological brain, controls the functioning of physical health) positions are stronger, where fractal roots are more intelligent breaken into little parts; and the fractal sum forms another head (psychological head, operates inside system of head as a general).
 - Five elements have the head, in human contained as three-chakra distribution of flexibility, for matter it has one chakra: with the matter, contemplate which is the unified, non-individualistic position of the three chakras - X² (X octave up) instead of ZXY.
- We call the chakra system as a "visualization": it's only a mental system needed to recognize and classify each bodily and mental function. Elements of five is such as well. In functions of higher reality, they appear smooth and gentle, converging into truth: in diversity of your body and mind, you see them as rough centers of complex, irregularly distributed functions; only a Mind gives our body any symetries: this is a Visualization. We could have so many chakras: but we are not able to count more than 5 and 7 significant points of anything: to understand, to combine, to always watch we cannot do with anatomy map or mendelejev's table - this is a high mind, which learn all this table; this must be insane to learn each combination with each. By this, we follow the simpler laws of frequencies to build our understanding - the experience of so subtle things that we could lose the symmetries and come into irrational singularities of experiences, much like shamanism ..we do not pass the scientific test to measure the complexity of our life and vision and will.

We combine the exercise:
- We exercise each position of the body, in body-hand opposite. We just take this position and keep it for all exercise time; this means we already exercise the opposite part on the matrix.
- We execise each position of the palm, another opposite, in real and moving way.

We can relate three - twist and roots of thumb as a center; positions of palm and body as two directions from this center.

We practice far-away exercise, which gives some training to intermediate positions as well, to come closer to completeness.

We might come back and follow body movements keeping each learnt position of hands, to unify the paths we learn.

We need to know about how the structure propagates through fractals of nearby positions and theories, and deeper meanings of positions and theories (see physical attention, awareness and consciousness). We want a crystal ball with all the disposition in your target zone of exercize: to approach Zen, you make the bubble smally larger and try to balance the external as well; by single steps, the positions come: you become just a little more than you are, but in every respect; from every position - radiating the awareness of positions into more conscious mind of more limitless experience.

Yin and Yang: yin comes to sharper focus, mastery of one area of attention; yang comes closer to Zen, a non-focus and void, it comes to wider set of positions. To do two times less of exercise is not a big difference, because difference is rather an exponent factor of growth: rather, Tao is then to practice both focus and unfocus; this why I am here starting with this: find a fractal piece, and aspect of the whole or the balance, which you want to train. Nothing is a final point focus or a final focus of equilibrae, of whole reality coming from void of concentration.
- Excess of concentration: you become in box, rigid structure of will, which wants to live comfort zones.
- Excess of disperse focus: you are not a specialist, then the whole does not focus - it will stay in it's brain mind.

Paradox of focus: it's ideal is to be unfocused, distributed evenly inwards and outwards directions; inner and outer focus does not appear by this goal - it appears from uniqueness, which allows you to recognize the society: this is taught by Confucius, who you might miss for evilness if your buddhist is ought to never concentrate, to never let them see his small part despite of the large candle in the hologram: the hologram moves to the brain, and body remains unintelligent. In the paradox: to come close to the small, you focus on one part as if it was the whole; to come close to the big, you focus on the whole envisioning it's small part. Equlibrium is in equilibrium with something else: yin, the "evil" of becoming not this ultimate reality, comes in; the ultimate reality will change it's skinn through eons and reincarnations of all the Creation - linearly, through time, it passes the concepts you so naturally see in Space; the diversity of each God, in Hindu religion - it appeared from three single-God religions and while it understood the deeper essence between reincarnations is the same, it's one God, functions of these three were too different to not learn these lifetime-radiations of God. Essence of God never dies, but in our partial reality, and His: we see Him coming and going; we see how the whole reflects into each part, vibrating into forms, which are Godly.

## Tao of Spirit and Soul - Special and General

There is the Yin, the Spirit, inside the Spacial and Unique:
- By eliminating rhythyms and replacing them with complex patterns of growth and chaotic metalinearity: you strenghten what you get more easily, what is stronger or naturally stronger. By this, you strenghten your unity and your uniqueness, you understand that you are not the center of an external world: yield with your life, train whatever becomes stronger, whenever the lack becomes weaker. You move in directions of the current to remain in the line: follow this Confucian path to find unity, to find balance in external world where you are center only by chance. Take your unique part, projector of the holotrope (I use the word: holetrophe; for the vivid life of holotrope): you yield the singularity of particular point, but up and down you can vibrate that you are not a center neigther to microcosm or the macrocosm: your vibration and direction comes from chance and higher guidance, and adds to the whole; balanced, symmetric image becomes and breaks into thousand individual pieces, up and down from the organism of the single muscle.
- I use "muscle" (down) or "nerve" (up), "brain" (in, trospection) or "projection" (out ter world): not to physical device itself, which is not of our imagination and has complexity of synapses or connections; the logical part, which allows you sense or intention, introspection or outwards synchronization, I use the symbols to these rather imaginary beings.

There is the Yang, the Soul, inside the General and Common, the Normal:
- Inside each of us, there is the common pattern of Life we need to spread in each direction, such as North, South, East, West, Up and Down of the fractal. Notice that dividing the Dimensionality into Special Dimensions is R^n => (R[ * R] times n), necessity in metaphysical space and contains unknown direction of Dimensionality, which comes into relations in metaphysical abstraction of general formulaes, or specific projections where we find symmetrically shaped random directions for the base axes, for particular cases, and relational systems for interrelated cases. This paradox has involved some to believe only in Dimensionality, which is not a term for actual special cases or theoretical, uniform (symmetric) mapping.
- We balance our training to get closer to having each position, where our mental body of balance is growing like a plant: as we try to break through, stay at our edges gently for long periods of repetitions, and also get the central muscles grow from almost zero movement, new and new internal layers coming from the center: it's very important to grow the layer we use for common living, which we use to keep going for whole day, in positions for whole night; practice also lying positions to be strong when you are sick or tired: lying, sitting, standing, moving, jumping, each is a skill for life.

Understand your city life and homedo, as well as any specific circumstance:
- Which are the muscles getting advantage, so that it's easier to train them and they are higher in balance?
- Which are the ones needed or tired, so that you could exercise them?
- How this relates to Yang: how you change your holistic pattern to reach outer opposition of them, and nearby opposite positions which are next least to become trained by these exercises?

Contemplate on the missing parts of your life to train specific complexes and syndromes, such as hands or specifically palms for more stable and complex work, even mental (as you control some axes or parameters and it's like a physical process), foot and legs for liberty in movement in positions, for logistics, transportation and taking part of several clubs or meetings. Train your hips, and what connects body and legs around root chakra, including their central connections to form the whole physical chakra: to get stance before the solar plexus. Move through the symbolic resonances of the body, it's inherit synchronicity - you find meanings of the areas reflected in physical, mental and absolute space.

So you need to:
- Strenghten your unique qualities
- Strenghten the common qualities

You would think it takes a lot of time. It does not, because dividing 50-minute exercise into two 25-minute halves, halving each repetition, singularly does not weaken your exercise much. This happens in where you see one part and the surrounding whole as being half and half of the same thing.

You don't lose critically much from one half, when you train another the same time, even if you have two half-time exercise patterns rather than one full-time; this is quantitative change and the quality of balancing even the balance itself opens up the head of this fractal, the first distribution - you distribute, evenly, the internal and external combinations, which is an optimization operation of my mathematics.

3D positions and directions are very simple, but your body is magical: like a shaman, it's proportions of abilities and muscles of will, nerves of sense, their tao passing the internal union and external answer to it, .

# Your absolute body

Somewhere you have the Theorems and resolved Karma: as deeper your Karma resolves, as more commonly it's positioned in index system of understanding of each life, where you grow your fractal from new basis to form an unique, non-repeating cycle (spirit) with your common essence (the soul); Absolute Body never dies.
- It has pains, which do not make pain, but each pain resolves fundamental things. Unresolved, they provoke fear.

Absolute, Physical and Mental body are one important division of a balanced variable or linear classificator.
