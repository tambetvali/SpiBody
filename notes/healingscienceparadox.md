# Healing Paradox

I am quite fortunate to have very broken teeth for like 20 years - I did some mix of meditation, toxic components or bad eating habits; I wanted to get rid of any cure of the tooth which seemed like alien materials to me when I was 17, I meditated them into red color, they got very broken and I saw it before in my dreams, and after in one vision, which powerfully told me they heal "when the war is over" - not explaining the war, it could be a psychological contest, a journey to get up on my legs and remove the tensions, which I have to my perfect life.

Teeth are interesting example of currently more or less non-curable problem. When I was child, it was reported that there are laser and implant technologies to plant teeth; later my sister made a remark that those produce cancer, and now I found the AI thinks similar cures are incomplete and any existing treatment can only heal some aspects and is prone to produce cancer, so it's not out of research labs. There was a list of people, who got some or all of their tooth impulsively, naturally healed at high age; this disappeared from internet. There was some team claiming they heal tooth by ultrasound machine - the least creditable of each of these -, but they responded to my letter that they are not the patent holders and it's not going to production; they did not explain what was failing or were they accused / "debunked".

So at this point I could figure out the whole science of what to do with non-curable. Instead, tooth could be fixed, not cured / healed, but this means some non-organic bodies and perhaps a limitation to natural cure, should it exist at some point.

Ancient world believed in miracle healings, and I had some felt success in early meditations - this, rather, was ruined and I concentrated on less direct conception, such as localizing the pain. Taoists believe teeth can be cured, and this is believed in numerous accounts, which are mostly more spiritual than material, and do not have repetition of confirmed materials - with philosophical mind, still, the claims of people based on historical accounts, personal stories or metaphysical concepts or generalizations are each interesting, since philosophy creates a safe realm of studies into different beliefs without getting distracted from truth; we consider the real and symbolic meanings, metaphors and confusions to distinct one from another - for example, question of material and spiritual alchemy, where people see the same pictures representing different paradigms of context; rather turning them into more general logic, which could hold in spiritual, material, intellectual or symbolic contexts as well, where the same science could associate the same positions of the same theorems into different aspects, in different models (paradigms), creating seeming contradictions; there are also possibilities for real contradictions.

# With the probability, which I denote with letter "U" in my other texts, we have several possibilities

Teeth could be cured in one or another way. Then, we need to understand these ways.

By Taoist healing I first studied from my father - different schools of mystics and our family history as Cossacks or genetic tendencies to such mindset -:
- We need to remove the Cause. When my teeth are broken, this has causes - toxics in my body, some mental causes, forces flowing wrongly.
  - Teeth break, in my case, in systematic manner, forming symmetries - the cause is then not in themselves, but in larger structure they form part of; philosophically the cause-effect relation, such as internal and external connections, symmetries of similarities of structure or symmetries in interaction and reactions, such as using the same vessel of blood for teeth in four corners, such as up and down, left and right. The pain, as well, follows such symmetries - for example, tooth downwards has pain at the same time with tooth upwards on the same position, where one could trigger another or start at the same time.
  - This system means that healing the gyms and all those energy systems is a natural part of removing the cause, because the system, which distributes this relation, is part of the pain, and more probably it can be cured naturally as it's made of flesh, bones, systems of elixires of the body.
- We need to strenghten each part of the body, which is hit by non-local pain. They, once again, are rather bones and the flesh and can be cured by natural means like many illnessess, which touch us. Existence of pain might mean they contribute to the healing, for example this might be compassion - such compassion, as pain, means change, if there is pain, there is probability that healing from the pain, such as strenghtening the structure or meditating on it, or providing it vith nutrition, massage etc., would create the efficient cure.
- We need to cure the fractal: energy system of teeth is connected to each part of the fractal, as each muscle and other thing in body forms part of a web - for example, when training fingers, this also creates tensions in other parts of the body; as you train fingers with proper exercise, you train this other part with fingers, but once it develops, you can train it directly - it's also part of the local muscle system or muscle. The fractal could reach up and down: physiochemistry outside the body, such as existing in smell, which moves others (we can see some muscles heavily responding to other people around, or some systems responding, and I mean rather this natural reaction than something mysterious or hidden - sharpening your senses, indeed, creates many association and notices patterns and logic, leading to mystery of how you could get a stronger health in personal and holistic aspects, such as being present in society, it's interactions and collaborations); into cells, atoms or electrons: wherever something structured can appear, there could be material or energy-holographic structure of impulses, reflections, responses and patterns, which relate to smaller movements or smaller movements around the axes of positions, for example if you let the palm turn into natural position it has when hands are at front, it can find neutral axes where there are least tensions - doing very small circles up to very fast speed, and the small circles grow bigger bringing forth even smaller circles or faster speeds; the smallest developments most often spread to areas of body or the whole body and the repetition activates even smaller patterns in the fractal. Teeth can be broken in mouth, but exist in all the fractal - this could be partial reason for having the ghost sensation of lost body parts, such as sometimes feeling the full teeth and their developments, when there are none. Healing this fractal and the ghost teeth would remove the interaction cycle of teeth and feed it.

While we cannot cure teeth easily, these three methods behave as the cure by natural means would behave in each curable organ - if teeth can be cured, taking care of these and many other aspects would be a way there.

If teeth can not be cured, or if I don't have time for this:
- These three methods and numerous others, while they are consistent with first hypothesis that teeth can be cured, it's consistent with second hypothesis that they can not in this sense: curing all these systems localizes teeth pain and removes many side-effects, where even the causes of sickness can cause other types of sickness. Combinations of the hypothesis is that while teeth can not be healed, many consequences of broken teeth can be healed - such as having "off-days" caused by pain and injury. I have recovered the energy system of my body to state, where it's least affected by health of broken teeth, as much as my best practices allow me.

So, while something we miss can not be healed so certantly, we benefit from the cures, which help us to remove each part of the complex of our problem, which could be removed.

# Types of healing

Meditation: I started with meditation. This has effects on the pain, but it's hardly a long-lasting solution, because meditation without physics creates an "approaching" effect: you get to close, temporary stages to your miracle, but it does not really happen; for example, you can cure it in a few days to the state, which would occur later otherwise - natural healing in environment of temporary health can occur faster, because the health can rest and relax and recover; however, if it needs constant tension and has slow solution curve - indeed, the body learns bit by bit from meditation - you cannot even know whether you progress further or actually backwards, for example as you grow older and lose some faith in work on long-progressing problems.

Medication: I do not like non-natural medication for pain killing and other pleasures, even if I would like proper vitamins or medicaments of refreshing manner - eucalypt, for example, is not a real cure for the teeth, but it gives temporary effect similar to small meditation. It might be back on it's partial health or non-paining once the effects of eucalypt end, and it provides you rather an organ, which is still healing: as much as pain itself makes an organ to heal, a normal pain-killer might not be so good for this; some common pain-killers include also catalysts, which are also naturally produced by some exercise, and killing the negative motive but providing this positive motive might turn this problem into a smaller scale.

Exercise: Exercise creates stronger body and provides long-lasting effects; non-rhytmic exercise cycles, which let the muscles become smaller and again bigger, create a healing complex of strength, and any other attribute, which slowly removes some of the need of constant exercise, which would be not lasting effect like meditation. Yoga-like system of exercising positions of hands and fingers, for example, with small strength and intuitive repetition of many times, improving flexibility, bringing new layers but not concentrating to get one layer to it's advanced strength (concentrating on some specific layers can be other half from your program, where in this general part you concentrate on some kind of orchestra of creating a balanced structure of some type of possible bodies - I think the balance is relative as you consider your opportunities and willpower, you could find somewhat different structures being balanced, while you might find more general definitions for balance over time - different people, definitely, are balanced in different ways, and the balance of your system would change with age).
- Exercise complements meditation: this is why Taoist system is interesting; with stronger body, the same meditations are much easier - when your body is weak, the meditation is mental and you have to be tense all the time, and to watch yourself, and things you meditate upon tend to show themselves like a mirage or fall apart; this is not bad, because for example in mental followings you learn the purest cause, and you might give a big deal to studies and purer truth at younger age, doing less holistic training. With exercise of proper energies and systems, the meditation's ability to affect matter, such as your will acting on restoring the health, or your good will actually providing good products: the meditation, here, as much as it can change you, is stronger and it creates more permanent systems.
- I think there is some "forgiving": for example if you have lost a part of your body, training the fractal system of this part and still keeping the balance could be seen as "good will" by the nature, or a healthy motive - thus, provoking a forgiving effect where your results would satisfy you more and affect the actual outcomes; you could be better, where it means, than someone ignorant with better relative possibilities.

Miracles: developing each system to it's maximum could produce faster and stronger effect; I do not know whether the natural laws can extend indefinitely - some might suggest that and I would point out it does not alter this practice too much; to expect a miracle with minimal input and lack of mindful response to existing realities, this is compatible with least probable hypothesis of your own miracle healing. And - after the miracle, perhaps you still need a healthy and trained body? I think there is higher probability for existence or appearance of miracles, which are not this temporary: perhaps you heal, but if the cause remains there, you will be hit again. Indeed the cause can be something you do to others: just because it could be _solution_ instead of a _problem_, to lack some powers or organs, where the system could barely respond if it does not weaken you for reason, instead of just killing the dangerous, I suggest not to make your problem a solution for an external force, which might not respond so magically - but it rather would easily respond using available possibilities or reaching some extreme degrees of such relation; yin aspect of life is to remove external reasons for your suffering, even if you could see they can not affect you so instantly or intelligently. Do not seek one "magic mechanism", but rather look at the causes and effects of life - the model, in your mind, might seem like one cause and effect, while in your life somebody might lose interest of preparing against your sensations of being tired or especially energizing food; in the complex system, internal and external reasons might not align, but it's important to notice they break or tense the logic of life by this degree, and we won't assume we are secured against it if it's in bigger interests than ourselves. So, by all means, going further than just directly protecting yourself - you should take care that your interest is also the interest of others, and there are no "physical or biological exceptions", as if this rule would hold only in abstract ethics: abstract ethics, as much as it's a science, is in close relation to each material sphere of actual life and it's ecosystem; if nothing would respond, evolution would have tendency to recover not only person-wise, but also organ-wise or ability-wise, and compared to other forms of evolution, which just kill the weaker, an actual evolution would kill the batteries and forms supporting the weakness - if you become weaker by your organs becoming stronger, do not think it's not a physical paradox; "abstract ethics" here relates just to physical scenario.

Community: the "idea world" and also the unified strength of our healing will multiply as we consider this something we socially do, also providing for others in response to their goodwill or actual potential. Sometimes we do not lose from helping those, who do not trivially help us so much (see the thermodynamics).

Biology: we have many ancestors and relatives, who share some genes, and most important genes can probably find ways over the distances between species by various means - even if they are cloned or components just eaten. Reptiles and frogs can cure themselves etc. Nerves were thought not curable, then thought curable in a century - so it's very probable that we contain biological mechanisms, which were capable for some animals, such as being capable for helping frogs or helping them to evolve into their forms, but they would be slow or partial for us. We might have tendency to cure things we can not cure. Perhaps we would completely cure if we were immortal.

Biological creativity: we do not know, what constitutes the creativity of biological systems, but just like the medicine is progressing - also important for us -, our bodies progress in finding solutions and getting rid of the past problems; this can happen in lifetime. We should use non-repetitious or otherwise complex exercise in addition to symmetric and repetitive movements to produce the patterns, which require our organism to develop more creative learning; we need to have complex pattern of obstacles and distractions in our life - for example, first you train muscles, but then you train them faster or rather you train principles and muscles rather grow. Seeing our body as somewhat imaginative system able to complex transformations and evolution would keep us going further.

So, we can define the "natural cure":
- It's possible it's not curable or that it's curable.
- It's possible that we have what it takes or we do not.
- It's possible we know later.

The natural cure of the sickness, rather than concentrating on each problem, finds the networks of connections between problems and solutions and networks between different problems and solutions; for teeth you heal gyms, raise general energy levels, heal the systems which must be beyond the pain and problems given they occur symmetrically and thus more often / probable than not, not so locally or specifically. You can train muscles to have some movement of teeth themselves, and you can train the surrounding areas, to directly empower their system - stronger system, even with the same objective level of pain, has relatively less bad responses to it and relatively more motivation and strength for transforming it to positive pain, a cursor for the cure, advancement, healing and evolving.

With the natural cure, we find each possible explanation and surprisingly we find the actual work we can do is the same in each case - organism, in general, has a very strong principle that to help one part is to help another part, and rarely it means to destroy one part is to help another. Thus, we recognize the position of our problem, in this case - the teeth -, and the systems, which cause, interact, compassionate with the pain and the problem, or where the pain spreads. We use exercise - sometimes the exercise creates direct feeling of it getting stronger, even the non-existent teeth; sometimes the exercise would create pain in the current moment - then, we must consider the strategies to get the exercise done, if it's strenghtening, and avoid the local effects of pain in the present moment.

I have managed to have some "opening clicks" for bones, or structures resembling bones, lately, and while the tooth might be of different material, it does not have so different element as a sensation of our biological system: we sense it as quite the same element with bones. Thus, in fractal of theories and systems, the theory to heal the bones would associate with proper experiences to find the relatively close theory for healing the tooth, which is very probable - thus I will study "__Bone Marrow Nei Kung__ _Mantak Chia_" to find out the experiences with the bones; Taoism includes some for tooth healing, which I would definitely evaluate for my purpose of healing with my personal strength and the personal situation of the reality. Since the bones give "opening clicks", which are so similar to some of the muscle, that I see they must develop - yet to learn, in which sense (there is chinese exercise of hitting the metal, which I saw in the movie, and I tried some of my own version of it for some period - medicine, commonly, thinks the bones do develop from exercise and the teeth do not, and that they are different; if teeth would develop from some exercise or aid, closest to more general principle would also involve experience with the bones, even for understanding the difference of what is there, and how we would experience and affect it by practical means - for example, structures of muscles are different, but the methods for an exercise have big differences, which are very hard to express or to directly see, rather what we actually _know_ is the repetition of movement and repetition of movement against some obstacle, or otherwise engaging it into some activity). If I succeed to engage the teeth in _any_ activity, such as I learned to move them with muscles, indeed with initial condition of some exercise being good, while other have been done too much or with improper method and conditioning - in overall, the experience of involving teeth and all connected systems and teeth-part of each fractal (the stage of the exercise, which would create sensations in teeth, especially when succeeding, such as weeling the non-existent tooth "breaking", where it's hard to say whether we experience real teeth or the teeth-connected structures of the body, which emulate or simulate the layers of teeth _symbolizing_ it's health and condition - do not forget, our senses are abstract and reflecting rather the useful information and useful controllers or intent-centers, than directly reflecting the physical, biological and chemical responses, which are far more complex; we develop more senses in the actual systems, but overall - even those are emulations, and we still have bigger force capabilities with non-differentiated parts; for example, the four fingers form two pairs - the first, non-differentiated exercise would move all of them at the same time, in the same way; the more differentiated exercise or longer repetition of the first breaks them to two groups and the next differentiation gets muscles for separate fingers - still, the one which has four united, will always be the strongest and the activity of such kind will remain taking less mental and physical force, or we could do it with more speed, flexibility, intelligence or any other property - with intelligence being the most exception as it's also intelligence to have four separate fingers).
