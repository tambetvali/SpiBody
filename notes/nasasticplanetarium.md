# Planet Yoga

Imagine a large planetarium - a place to prepare biologic life for planetary life. The future, then, debunks every day all the theories about people, who prepare for the Sun; for millions of years, they search for scientific methods and __emphatize__ achemecents (i.e. alchemists), who want to turn turt into adamantium, in order for their Burning God to life physically into another cycle of the infinity. This kind of parallel to modern situation would lead into 5 million years later, where yogis have actually debunked many scientific myths, but the polar masses would rather believe some ancient form of sport into their lives, looking like reptiloids (I use this word randomly in positive and negative sense, because two archetypes lead to classification of human race rather by personal traits than any belonging; while I use reptiloid commonly by one given definition for person co-thinking with spine brain, but here as I use in my thoughts sometimes: a person with ancient ethics, to use _only_ their spine brain or lower spine brain to exist physically - by lower brain; let's imagine all this definitely has developed itself in this future: for example, a perfect material theory, which ignores training for any other chakra, but still achieves time-compatible sensitive needs, such as extrasensory perception and intention, or technology devices / muscular techniques which are "inseparable from magic" by means of advancement in biological and material / machine engineering - let's imagine, in the future society or hermitage in forest, living to today's tradition in little houses or skycrawlers or ancient buildings for least time, perhaps also in Moon and Mars condition or nearby galaxy condition at times of arrival, or in some future).

For technical reference: how much would pay the todays market for more natural probabilities to survive on Jupiter or Saturn? From science fiction, we easily find biotechnological changes, such as big fat people with resistance to mass, which could be achieved by any means imaginable - in the past, human would imagine at least very strong material body structure, thus very strong food grown on the same planet - tissues from the food, when compatible to human, would allow achemecents to find external adamantium drop-ins. Those would turn human into mentally, physically and spiritually able to live on Mars and Saturn, and combine with biogravity experiences of vibrating masses and other physically available means of that time / or of today, to grasp the original meaning (as a future-sense strong person, I happen to logic like logex E that you go in time backwards in you mind - but it's not time, but sentence-logic, where the future matter clarifies the past and end of sentence clarifies the precedings; I use symbols "<" and ">" respectively before / after sentence inner separation, function or operator, to show such direction of time, but it's natural to grasp the whole logic of the sentence tautologically not so dependent on it's linear time in order, because the sequences are multidimensional).

Imagine the inner achemecents develop exercise, which uses human's own physical and mental powers, as well as any available conditions or materials, or any part of the training, which is achieved solely physical, mental or spiritual intent, effort or force, whichevers prove true by some sciences, alternative - or pseudosciences. Hypothesis might _a priori_ connect them all into single question matter, where the time might give fractal of theories in paradigm or theory - the latter proving true in several or each paradigms, but on unrelated axes proves cross-paradigm alignment as logical failure unless logex axes are found, or for example a mental body.
