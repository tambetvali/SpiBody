The actual training is more or less repetition of the same movement and philosophy; the books are rather to get 3 or 5 pages and work on it for long - thus, I am happy with the few pages of text in root folder; building a healthy structure of you is absolutely creative and genial activity, but it does not consist of words.

Despite this, the actual field of exercise is undepletable and there are infinity of positions, creative ideas and complexes - princess of Spain inspired me with the word "notes" about a collection of texts like my Spireason's main page, so I don't really care about how long they get here.
