# Our Ritual

Because the following gets longer than this, I give you the main idea:

  You can create your own rituals, ones which are very reglemented, with rigid structure or content, or ones which are very free and creative, involving call to one's own soul.

You should learn ancient rituals to see that which is already developed to perfection, but you could also see - for the things you see in society and yourself, a ritual like a meditation, which can have given sequence or free creativity, can be teached from your masters, or made by yourself; and the masters might teach certain freedoms or you can create it for you as a process of contemplation.

The virtues we see in reality - why not to create rituals about them? Using an ancient symbolics, or a new, decent concept of the mundane progresses we make. As you do ritual, you move this organ, and you become suddenly able to express this virtue in reality, conditions of your own life.

This is an exercise for the society you paricipiate, rather than yourself, which has it's direct senses there: but it's closest to your eyes and ears, and your own muscles if you are not a public: your muscles of mind still trained.

Materialization in the physical world is when it is sucessful; we see here the muscle move. For things we can live in our life, we can say it's equivalent to the muscle work.

# Ritual as Exercise of God

Taoist ritual: I now watched a Taoist movie - you can find one, there is not many -, which gave me three practices or tenets of Taoism:
- Help others (with these three things)
- Practice rituals (of these three things)
- Exercise of Health (health of others, rituals and yourself)

__Tenet__: it's a word overflip where it means the same in my language as in common language; it's not a Taoist-specific expression in those translations, but a word I gave you to conpemplate on. Remarks in bracets might also be mine - I just wanted to show how the energy would pass the crown chakra and come back to root, in being little bit interested in mathematical Kundalini in my teachings and thoughts.

Now, why we need rituals? Taoist sees this as a part of their physical practice, where the movie explains:
- Rituals target a certain need for entertaining activities.
- Singing in rituals trains vibrations in throat (indeed, to learn body vibrations, this is among the starting points or force centers - you cannot avoid training the centers more, but then you train the whole body and interaction of the center and such body with the external world; in three bodies of chakra: the planar body, the fractal head and the force center or organ body, much like a large acupuncture point if you want to imagine such thing in level of organs, instead of something more close to organelle).

## Vibration and Octaves

Is God able to embody a physical embodiment; and then could it's not be real by it's property to be an accurate reflection of a perfect thing?

1 Octave equals to 7 chakras, or it equals to Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang exist on three meridians.

Now pay attention to these freely downloadable books, hopefully for ever:
- The ultimate guide to chakras, Athena Perrakis, Ph.D.: ultimation is a situation, where outer-brain area of Chrown chakra and under-root areas or actual tree roots on some images, where outer-brain (that which is outside of energy body, often at least as far as outer body or shell body of it's area's distinction); well she wants to be aware that in her life paths, paths on planets or the paths of her home systems model yin and yang for our current disposition. Home is more like a synchronized floating around here and there in dimensions, where dimensions can appear out from many formulaes.
 - The books states Earth connects us to bones of our ancestors: then, which part to bones are typically not destroyed; is there a mental aspect that their stance after death is very strong? When we train bones, is the mental counterpart or imaginery and simplification in training bones, which in one kung fu movie means exercise of doing 1000 little hits to metal plate, perhaps you can even make it's connection less solid like vibrator of a gong plate? The hits there are gentle, but the experience should propagate throughout the body: more flexible or stronger bones also need more flexible and/or stronger connections.
- The free pdf without author's name is called "Earth Star, Soul Star & Minor Chakras". For those who know the classical chakras, it's the patch to their picture so that they can own a paradigm.
- "Level 1 Sound Healing Practitioner Training", about author "Thyme With Charlie": it has similar chakra connection. This should serve as introduction to some vibrational theory of actual body.
- 144000 chakra system is provided, which might give some organization for your stability - you can figure out, to who is this exactly addressed.

## Imagine a singlification of being

Imagine if humans were tissues or cells of something bigger.

Ritual, while it's heavy activity in this frequency, it does not achieve or aim anything: it simply reflects, what could be seen in creative and accelerated space as doing simple repetitions for similar, definitely (without finit, for example acceleration is simply accelerating, and the last level of this tree as well: 3 here could symbolize infinity, but a fraction of it's **more precise** infinity) accelerating moves.

Imagine God doing "1500 good things" exercise:
- Could 1500 people appear in a church, each having their home-cooked bread: everybody, in one single switch with odd-counted player inviting one more half-couple spread. Well each of them did a good thing, but only as an exercise.
  - So what happens if a church head falsely gives you but a little aspect of bread? Is this exercise unlearned if you don't go to missas any more?
- Could people, for example, carry 1500 human-weight bodies of matter, such as trees, over a shallow river.

Normally, in a ritual, one can see it through Confucian eyes, Taoist action: doing a healthy amount of exercise every day, "God" appearing out of or into our exercise, eventually, on higher levels of vibrations or higher octaves; also the feelings of special qualities of things - such as their shape, color, smell, sound - as well as qualities of people doing this, and people vibrating along or aligning their compassionate abilities, which is also a such ritual.

150 people could randomly hand on 10 cups of coffee to each other randomly, with little fixes for even count of the whole algorithm - each create 10 cups of coffee in one go, and receives 10 single cups of coffee over day. This is already an usefulness exercise: but how much makes the coffee use?

In all 3 cases, 1500 empty exercises are done: in spiritual realm - that, where we see patterns of humans, large fractals with small leaves into their patterns of existence. This could be scientific realm - one, where causes and effects in such pattern are analyzed up to it's practical degree and physical presence; are the end qualities of their skill apparently present in a spiritual people, and why to assume any cause as "special" unless it has similar attribute of it's creation itself, _a priori_? A "commoner" or a "special force", here in non-military contemplation: special force of workers, for example, has special unification, such as special roles and especially synergized tension; this could even keep us going at peacetime. Taoist rituals seem having a slight grasp of militarity, like something, which reminds uniform in first instance, and remains something like an academy hat in second glance.

Ritual is inheretly meaningless, where the meaning is recognized by our soul: something we deeply understand instead of some special effort. We should see it in the movement of physical and the energy body, where we sense certain deep meanings in moves, postures in their energetic meaning; such as certain move meaning a love.

This does not hold for rituals we do, where they contain an actual, appropriate meaning to the time: this holds for the muscle, which is appropriately meaningful for the time itself; considering we train an asset, which is creative and responsive, this creativity and responsivity or even responsibility does not cancel out the simple repetition of singular activity, movement of your hand in circular fashion, in some higher degree realities, where our accelerative algorithm sees accelerated space as a solid space: God, who is in higher frequency easiest to check in Kybalion, then indeed sees a solid muscle training of heavenly beings where a mundane being would envision creative effort; but it is creative effort as He cannot do it without creative effort - a normal, linear experience would appear running backwards in Gods reality, starting from the Middle of Time we intuitively have projected into year 2013: where acceleration itself becomes a mean, and you are already accelerating what you accelerated before.

A ritual exists in symbolic, accelerative systems - but it could not, in every instance, approach the higher creativity, which could appear creative even to God; approaching an unlimited collectivity, number of united infinity of humans would approach a Birth of something as an event in accelerated math or "God's world".

How we could define this "God"?:
- The absolute laws of reality, which are always in effect, in their totality of space and time, generalize into God. From concept of God, it is also implied that such laws must exist, as this is his Perfect Nature of Creation (studied by ancient Catholics, as well as others in the name of "Tao" or a higher principle of spirit).
  - Absolute body of God must be this.
- What we consider higher, is considered to be God, while then lower principles can be attributed to Satan or chaotic attributes of the given, _a priory_ existence: God is the Total Force of Love, Unity, Wisdom and any other good traits, and the universal pattern, which emerges from those traits being efficient. Accumulatively, each trait finds an obstacle: this kind of frequency is not fully conscious in God's mind, because the frequency of "Consciousness" is not such.
  - The laws, when resolving, would remove themselves (in their advanced patterns) so that the absolute becomes a fundamental: fundament or foundational force, one of our higher desires versus our pure material flow will appear.
  - As the laws are already in effect, for the word "God" would not appear in parallel, unreachable reality: the seed, which gives birth to such "Force of God" would be immanent in principles such as evolution and optimization, in principles of resolution to such laws into synchronicity and synergy, versions of the same concept. We say it's our God that which is already in effect, whether we believe in God or not. We say that, which is in effect, must be God, but not in utter materialization of his principle: in terms of that suffers and goes away, into it's very principle, and becomes Dead, we cannot say a permanent wov would have been God - rather, it's the seed experience into this Godly existence.
  - This, because we do not want to only define God as reality, but we want to *equalize* the God's name into such unresolving principles: Material, Mental and Mathematical totality of ethernal principle can be named by it's own name, and still it's the name of God.

In this world, we then see how the ritual is but a repeated contraction and release of a muscle - still, the ones, who participiated, will see the much higher, heavenly or godly, awe-creating wave of their efforts in the ritual; in the power to change ourselves: in each case, we can see we are able to use the gained response, emotional state and attitudes of the ritual, we see we can cultivate them deeper and deeper when the ritual is mixed with reality. That given, we cannot say that the reality itself does not produce a ritual - such as, a marriage is a real marriage.

# Does human have an egg cell?

Looking at humans, echoes of potentials or realities of aliens - a fantasy genre still containing a deep touch of common human wisdom.

Stories, where frequencies - complex patterns of any kind of fractal or hologram property, or comets and meteors, which can temporarly enter air containing unicellular organisms or ones of complex structure, and thinking about reincarnations of planets, nations and ecosystems; thinking of how an evolution could anticipiate the future. Of what the Nature can get grasp on, it will use - even just to catch a fly.

It's interesting:
- 5 element systems of Europe, based on 4-element systems of Europe, and of China, are of remarkable similarity and fit.
- A "civilization", tough they are made of very different matter, always have something essentially human, a repeated structure (so that they could be seen as things of the same species, not just a free will or creativity, which is like painting on a skin, or difference in skills and abilities).
- Shamanism, our common ansestry, is followed by Alchemy, Magic, Religion and metaphysica system such as Science or Buddhist philosophy (of equality). Technologies follow in similar order.

Then, does human itself - with it's body, history and civilization - have a genetical structure? Does it have a genesis from far in the past, when the oracles were yelling the name of the humans coming? Is this genesis, structure of an egg cell, with genetical vitamins being eaten and shared, with telepathic field resonance of holograms, not only of beings, but of civilizations: does it bring, from ancient worlds and far places, into us the materials of eggs; does it turn us into normal beings, which can be grown into common civilization?

In my mental eye, I have seen patterns of civilizations emerging in the Universe: it's a fractal or physical hologram itself, with harmony and essence on each level and any chaos or misorder being a natural part, a part neglected by structure of their genes as (a) reality. In this history feeling, it seems rather than unexpected development, to be as natural to grow into a civilization, as naturally a child would look into growing a man. Every new technological development only awakens a gene, a natural use, a compability with our body - it does not come as such a big surprise, but rather compares to the "mirror on the wall", something natural and thinkable, such as a "miracle lamp". Humans almost do not believe such things would not exist: yet, it seems, they are covered by clouds and impossibilities, to wait the future: while a tehcnological drive might be an innovation, the actual appearance of those things is not new.

# Training over knowing

Perhaps it's better to do a ritual, and wait for knowledge (understanding and experience to come): trained muscle opens the sensation of possibility - rather than trying to do something right now. Human muscular system can be close to perfect, approaching to natural law on each level; we might know our abstract rituals - muscles to train.

What is our body?
