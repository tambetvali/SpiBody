# Giving and Receiving

Taoist first Tenet (I say "tenet" for such a thing) is to help others.

Then think more Confucian, by connecting the larger scale:
- Help Others and let Others help You

People look for work, they want duties and responsibilities, such as having a family.

If each person has excess energy flowing, as more as they get into relaxed, comfortable zone, they cannot step a first step to their karmic advantage, given by honour, which would appear: be it on your side, or against you (this means helping others).

Karmic circle is like movement of Chi, or the energy movement in two directions in 7 chakras, like opening Kundalini up and down (Heavenly creatures should start from the second - to materialize, Earthly creatures from the first - to float): in roughly the same equilibrium, or the total space, you need to give as you can, and receive as you need; you need to give what they need and receive what they can. Each of the four letters forms an alignment of this two-directed channel in both frequencies: to the future (higher) and from the past (lower); the current moment is like a solar plexus - it's the "now", standing still, where the metaphysical axes are passing by, still inside (the coordinate system, which is now moving itself).

We need to cultivate the Tenet of letting others help us, to enable them to receive their karmic advantage. Karma, to function, needs some input: advantage has some tendency to materialize on it's own, but when it exists: it can make it's ethical victory.
- Parts of our bodies win in medicine
- People win in personal stories
- Planets win with civilizations
- United realities win
- What exists, wins

Chakras (I use my own numbers):
- *Y*: With the Crown, Reality wins. Power of Realization is active here.
- *X*: With the Vision, Concepts of Reality win. Power of Engineering is active here, including socioengineering.
- *Z*: With the Throat, the Victory Spreads like a Wave. Power of Communication works here.

- *E*: With Heart, unique stories unite into the whole. Mind power is active here.
- *A*: With Solar Plexus, person's story is especially connected with those around. He is mentally a single person and physically contained in his body, being well aware of others around in similar way, and being able to generalize into the world consisting of so many persons, organic bodies with unity minds or *egos*. Thought power is "superior" here.
- *O*: With Emotions, conrete things take fine-grained directions towards infinity. Taking Care is the power here.
- *I*: With Roots, concrete things exist. Working and Receiving is the power here.

In the **Root Chakra** (*I*): To give and receive, to work, is the necessity here. Each time you find a way to help another to help you, even the false messianistic people, you enable them to close their karmic circulation.

What is a karmic circle? *See also*: thermodynamics.

- An energy is what enables a thing to be.
- This is interrelated with surroundings.
- It needs to reach somewhere, and come back.
- Objects exist in equilibriae, where each of the circles is connected and open to potential.
- The circle needs to be usefully and potention-exceedingly (that give more than is needed for this) connected in both or each of the directions, where each thing can exist only in circulation.
- Honour makes us recognize the permanent people, while Materialism helps to best use the advantages of current situation and help the people around us.

On personal basis, to allow them to help you in Tao, or to go away in Zen if you decline this by will, or to see this in others to play your unique part in the Spirit, where Souls make us the same and Spirit makes us unique; so you need to be somewhat the same, somewhat unique in who you let to help you, in who you help in this, getting back to who you help? Each principle needs to exist in the ideal world and pure conception.

To get the effortless work and excess progress, let others keep doing.
