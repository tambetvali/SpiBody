# A breath exercise

Far more than lacking an effort to exercise, my problem is: my breath is just too weak.

With breathing, or conscious movement of those "free-time" autonomous muscles, I gain some aspects; with exercise physical muscles around, especially in their freedom: there becomes a ball you can get tense around your body ..but what makes the breath real?

You can do this series:
- In span of a few months, exercise jumping on your feet, with legs straight, jump on your ankle joint. You can do it a few times - initially, if this is weak, you need fast jumping for a while, but try to avoid excess pain.
- As the ankles get strong: this jumping starts, soon, if you jump free enough, to involve your body, which will use it's muscles to stabilize and establish the ankle joint. At this point, you can get the muscles around your breath very tired in short time: this brings a deep, natural breath which is using the active muscles.

Notice the symbolics of these muscles:
- A pretender jumps up, trying to pretend, convince and abuse position of being someone else.
- A person, who is lying down, is trying to get up; on the climbs of society, you walk up.
