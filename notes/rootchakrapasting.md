# Root Chakra: Pasting in Time

The old time can be seen as absolute past - the Metaphysics in Space is beyond the past, the limit value of the "Time" affecting us. You travel the metaphysical world and your Now, with it's "eternity" (in certain, mathematically well-defined cases it's "eternity", not Eternity); in the Eternity, value of Now is not just passing, but as the Eternity is shining through - the *known* about the above Space and Time passing window to the limit value of All, the the "God" in our senses -; you see what I call "Retaphysics" - as if the static, Void Eternity, including then the "God", is passing Time. In Eternity itself, to understand the complexity of these Windows, is to pass time - for the source of Meditation, Higher Senses and our understanding of God or Gaad (I use this word for higher Good, with certain associations to characteristics of God: but this force is only *approaching* to such power we would extend into God, deepifying the calculation and attributing the Source of this Force).

Whether there is God, gods or a metaphysical Rule is up to our mental games: inside the game, no answer appears; wave of philosophies will resolve each point, where the contradiction is *materializing*. Mathematics necessary here, is mine, for example: in it's ZXY scale, you can express each symmetric or non-symmetric frequency, even set of random points on this line (time), or in such space (non-symmetric) with a single number I express, possibly, with curved N almost like M in McDonalds - this means, a "Turn", where game M (Estonian: "Mäng") means a point in Space, which determines the whole logic. Numbers in Ponegative are interacting: what is one in relation to the other, and the other in relation to one, where the "other" is expressed by T and R in one order, the "it" (T, Time) "in relation to" me (relation - R, Space); notice the Space seems two-dimensional, comparing to time, and is in same relationship as calculating the relationships, connection and web; or as calculating the identity, such as you and me - they are not in 14T space, but in 58R space, which is decimal and letter representation: T is between 1 and 4 (14), R between 5 and 8 (48). 4 is the limit value between. The other, also, is shown in his own, and relational coordinates. OTARORAT, where O and A are me and you, T and R are am and in relation (to..). So numbers only exist in ponegative - while the relation between me and you are changing based on their values in space, A" and O" (A prim and O prim as their projected coordinates); then the values themselves are based on &A and &O, from programming languages, their absolute positions. This creates an inertial system: to provide these values with one, single number, an inertial system exists, in paradox such as Halting or Liar's paradox, or occasional fit (without a paradox).

Our worlds are constantly rebuilding themselves in such relations, and by Theorem of Incompleteness: the value is constantly converging.

It's questionable, whether infinite spaces in relation to finite spaces have infinite energy. It's not questionable that as those interact slice by slice, piece by piece, the finite space in interaction, trying to be equal, is depleting the infinite system: in infinite system, as a first point, between each interacting period, the relation of gains and losses are measured inside the period; when the periods are negatively shifted, the new infinity is calculated based on these series of relations, and it's negatively influenced. In the way how energy - solution space and it's guarantee or probability, as our energy is our solutions and not problems, which could appear with similar physical power: the *energy of mind* or *energy fields* a non-physician is going to see, is without doubt the energy, stillness or even losses appearing in their behalf, and not the energy, stillness or gains appearing against, which is a negative energy. "Seeing auras", the energy is such: the life-giving force, for example electricity produced by humans is produced by energy system ("system" is already approaching infinity), but the electricity produced by thunder could destroy our energy systems. Storm destroying our villages is not so clearly producing energy as the vitamins, and rather vitamins produce energy than toxicals; this has parallels in all common speak - for example, physically certain thing can "energize" you or "charge your batteries", like Red Bull, where a toxic element would have stronger physical influence over you, but in this sense, it does not produce energy: so when a sensitive is seeing energy fields, they are sensing such effects and not the opposites; sensing those energy fields are not required to take no thinking and emotional effort to decode, as well as it's not equal to being aware of any kind of physical field, which is simply too simple in it's relations to life, or even the ability to express "good and bad energy" - physics-centric person, rather, is fighting with invisible enemies in these discussions, rather than understanding, what they call "energy" in real life. Your expensive things, when you explode them with dynamite, you do not easily express as being "surrounded by red energy of fire"; rather the "energy" and "destruction" are sharp opposites, one is keeping the position, and other is turning into permanent negotion (in my terms, the "bad in bad" from 4 possibilities of Taú or Tao-space, where Taú is my mathematiciation, not so deep but very much reasoned, or a space to calculate it in it's *change in decision*).

Now, the energy of the past:
- It's a vibration lasting with you.
- It's a karmic field, which would change once you gather the experience; then you sense it as a "helpful obstacle", where it would remain in the Space: but not Time.

You see the Quantum Field:
- It keeps things in Schroedinger field: something, for you, is not certain, about the past, present and the future, until it's cast out of shadows of this field; so the whole spacetime is flexible.
- Overall, with quantum supersets as seen in quantum computers, the field is using all variables, to a degree of *flexibility* or *randomness in reason* (a random-flow-tunneling, where each event can be equally desired, but single outcome is needed; but when the whole tunnel of those events meets an obstacle, it can change directions or disappear in advantage to other fields - randomness is to a certain degree, a computation you need to apply on *equal opportunities* in process of their *materialization* or *singularization* - any factors of comfort and discomfort can change your field of randomness and choice, so this field is very flexible; for example you throw a ball in almost random direction, but not into a river, in certain situation).
 - In many cases, the reason to order or identify single elements appears only as they approach "material", "particular" world, or execution, but they are equally preferred in theory.

Imagine in a past one of these:
- People are watching the future on oracles, however dumb or smart those are, or estimation systems: while you might not directly influence such system, numerous factors of correlation present a wave of influence over your past; for example, your rhythyms turn out to be synchronous to *trustability* of certain people in the past, and you turn the wheels of the history; their goals exist in presence now: what was rightfully said about their goals and their relevance, is now changed by you; for example their goal to raise a family, their dreams of love and it's fruits, are wobbling with each euro you can give to their descendants; the voice of their chat, or whether you will see hidden signs of naivity or death on their image from it's vibration when you later look.
 - Notice Lemurians *died out*: **Arcturian in Atlantida – Sacred Lemurian Healing Frequencies & Light Codes** - looking at this YouTube video, one should notice: the lemurian woman looks sometimes as if there was a dramatic thriller music behind, like the lines of her face express dying-out; but we would not say the "meaning" of such face is to die out, or characterize certain feelings of her as sad, unless she *really* died out. This does not depend much on whether she is a myth or reality: in all cases, she herself is the symbol of what happened in this myth or reality. Atlantians were seen as being much better than average lemurian, almost an *ideal*, but they also died out: despite this, those who carry their causes, do not necessarily see them being sad in the same way. Sure, in each case it's not so sure we won't find those races or their families in the Universe, impressing us in very definite ways in different places; this is very funny that as the lesser races of the Universe bring their kings, we can never say it does not carry a certain meanings - while, for example, small angels of this world can be very miserable.

People in the past invent realistic sciences about the future: with all the causes and effects, and their interrelations, such people can be intert up to a specific degree; at some point of threshold of given events in the future, not their scientific prediction goes so much better in terms of calculations, but their whole cycular estimation *was then* different. This has certain metaphysical tendencies in what you are doing, relating to the past - in other words, you often *cannot remember* the exact number of repetitions in the past, or the exact thing, *before you are more consistent to the realistic estimation in the past, almost like you actually caused it*. Even quantum superpositions: while they always start going towards *better you*, and this could be only their argument on your quantum level and not the meanings of your mind, so directly; the quantum superpositions definitely combine less in case you combine more: seeing where the time starts going, you might be influenced by your future decisions, and create an open possibility field into the fractal future; now you see a complex throughoutput of the energy and information in time.

Notice what's going on in your nerves, and most moves your muscles: memories and knowledge are kind of latent state, existing in higher frequencies as a moving space and energy; your nerves are not so much about knowledge: they are also about *energy*. Self-fulfilling prophecies of good nature, and self-destructing prophecies of bad nature, are what happens with realistic estimations. Envisioning the future, we choose what's better to us, based on relative nature of the future. The knowledge, in this interplay of our growth, progress and estimation of the future, now is a charged energy: to be sure in this future, we know it, but we also approach it; to know and to avoid means it won't happen. Here the negative posetives appeared: an oracle was sensitive in bad way, to this effect, and subsequently chose a safer and more sure future for themselves; notice this is not a nature or definite need for oracles, but certain egoistic stage of development. For real oracles, the "Self" and "Other" are in interplay.

Physics has real causes and effects we measure locally: metaphysics counts the variables, which are in static positions, such as "True" and "False", and there appear more causes and effects of *why the reality is such*: then we ask, *what caused our reality*. Metaphysics of stable systems is yang to yin of alchemy in dynamic systems: those, which will go through chemistry, the infinity-estimations or meaningful guesses, a process where one unyields the realities, passes the journeys of mind: gaining the experience without their materialization; until they have deducted and inducted (negatively and positively implied) the journey they take in reality. Such as Sage can be an experienced teacher for a Hero, giving advice, or they might Neglect their own future: you can carefully analyze that instead of taking place in time and space, this process will *move* the time and space.

Past, then, becomes a potential field, with many possibilities and relations towards you: for example, whether your past investment was success or not, determines whether you was giving or receiving at that point; as much as left to real possibilities: whether you was giving or receiving, will affect the goal-system or "reality-system", in regards to their illusions, maya or "material-system"; where they were in Praxis, a mistaken sphere, in time the sphere is rotated into most realistic, and most favourable direction: so the coordinate system they had, is fixed from this illusion; but the things they were moving, might be partially in the future - for example, they were "working to give birth to all their descendants, for so many generations, to survive"; as the actual measure of this scale much resides in the future, and is the only part of the variable you change in the future - your ongoing resolutions of those matters, both financially or karmically, and ethically or dharmically, by Zen, where you let go of what you can not change: what you *can change*, is in relation to how you work with your past karma now. For example, in case you *change*, you are not *the same you*, and certain aspects of you are *forgiven* - while if you still settle those matters and pay their loans, your *karmic advantage* can become *absolute in this sense*, as your purity of those matters of past you are *out of doubt for everybody*.

As I mentioned in text about Trust: as you learn to pay not only your certain loans and debts, or only those, which are requested:
- You must not destroy the negative karma of others, as your impact might be removed, but after variable component analysis you definitely *remove any doubt*; or also you might not think many things in your advantage must be done by others: in case they ethically have to help themselves, you could still raise your probabilities by helping them. By this, you are being *greedy*, removing the doubt.
- You raise these strengths in you: people around you do not change, but each karmic chain by each aspect transcends, and even their experience is left there. Notice the Nature might be very strict to pay small depts, and for a good karma you be a Saint: others might be *responsible*, but it's still *your karma*. The karmic consequence might still yield you to the better people, even before this cause and effect takes place.
- You build yourself to be more useful, and stronger: it feels like the reality around you heals.

In these many respects, your connection to the past has to be healed: while the actual movement of the information towards the past is not certain, you still have the mathematical axes, where the practical things happening are measured in information positioning in dispositions of future and the past; on those virtual axes: in higher frequencies, Space appears, where things move in Space, not only in Time.
