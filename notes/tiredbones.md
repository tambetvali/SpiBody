# Bones get Tired

You should notice: as you train your bones for strenght, flexibility and lockability, as well as for flexible structure of the body (such as moving whole blocks, like changing some angle from 40-45 degrees to 45-50 degrees, by moving a bone container); you are sometimes getting flexibility, and sometimes losing it.

Bones, as well, get tired - when they are tired, you lose some functions, such as flexibility (and body is sure it never had, living in present): this might take a while until you get each function back, or you could just train more sometimes. Often, it's very good to notice when your body wants to close something for a while.

Tiredness is a fractal: if you did not exercise your joints and bones at youth, they get fractally tired until you lose all their ability at old age. In case you overtrained - such locks and pains might be temporal.

You will find how many features similar to muscles the bones have. Skeleton is your eternal essence: on mental and physical level, as you train the skeleton and skeleton-like strucutures, you will be able to stand, sit and lie down comfortably: an effort to stand still, instead of constantly falling back and moving further, is, on tissue level, associated with bones.

Notice the fractal of getting tired at youth, day by day and week by week - I do mean if you are disabled without sufficient reason, to put it simply - is also a fractal of theories: recovering from being tired, which can fractally start from simple exercises, and then gather bigger and bigger amounts of time; it is also teaching you and your body about getting tired principles, especially the principles of getting out. Do not let the principles to get tired.
