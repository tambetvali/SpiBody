# False Strength

What I name whichcraft, disrelating this from Shamanistic Practicioner:
- To go on straight, based on local condition.
- To follow an external criteria.

External criteria can be named Good and Bad: locally, each person is grasping the good, while they are fighting against the bad.

For example:

Good and Bad: to seek for reputation, to take those as enemies, who endanger one's position.
Beyond: to be modest, not pretend, and to show one's weakness. To take criticism like pain and shame, to be a fuel for growth, where Position is to become into your correct position.

Like animals and humans running (you can find videos of that):
- Animals are faster in beginning of the track.
- Humans will win on the long run.

This is because we are more intelligent - even physically. When animals follow the local condition and win, humans follow the long-term goals and finally overcome those victories. To think like Viking, where you make up the best of this: is to win wars and not battles in this sense; to rather move towards your objective position (sinus), to seek ideals higher than you (cosinus) and to be present in all this consequence, looking for one's right position (conus). This does not come solely from circumstance of life, but rather relies in seeking the higher grounds.

Witch is one, who tries to alter the *whole condition*:
- For example, they won't seek to not do harm, but they seek that others shoud do harm or look like this: moving relatively, but falling down absolutely.

# Consumption

When it gets better, those people run along, telling they were there all the time and they are the best for this position. When it gets worse, they run away, telling everybody they were never there.

As we grow stable relations: instead of getting rid of each suspect or to harm fatally, we get along into this yielding, and as our karmic cycles close the motivation comes - physical motivation to give each their proper part, not more or not less.

As they behave like hungry demons, they are moving to lower worlds throughout the lifetimes, would say a Buddhist; or to say it materialistically: waves of such intents and beings of presence, Universe would slowly experience to move those waves, becoming of them, towards less in center, and to create centers, which can create safe networks and distributions of energies for the higher, which collect together.

I think the reality would not kill those people completely:
- They are ancient and the past is promoting their existence: they are the mystery from the ethical weakness of the beginning times.
- You are the reincarnation of such way - killing this, it would mean you kill your past, or it's continuous emergence; without them to destroy their seed into infinity, on their own and by their own activity and karma; you, rather, would replicate their being - it's now your phase of development to find out about these mistakes.
- They are far above the zero, but above the zero is already an existence; even there, there are beings better and worse: it could be so much worse that there are ones, they live longer of.

Rather, the Universe is seeking intelligent solution:
- To throw away this old skin, it needs to resolve that the past exists.
- The reincarnations of them create much lesser infinities. In our bigger infinities, their vibration comes and goes, in cycles slowing down, but not easily ending.
- Their mystery needs to be solved: there is more and more of this.
- They resemble something good, like enlightened being, who is not usual: to understand, who is this enlightened person, who looks like fool, you are in this karmic trap of uncovering reality.

This fact that you have to cope, might be insulting to you, but about Buddhism, religion or the Universe there is something, what does not follow reason and ration - more often or not, it gives *some right* to the weaker. Your strength cannot be solely based on furious victory.

# Victory

You cannot desire complete victory, demolishion of life of your enemy: the reality, in it's paradox of Good and Bad, does let you surrender each time your thought is simplified to single disposition, such as love or hate. Love breaks and hate will make you suffer.

Buddhist mind cannot seek surrender of an enemy - an enemy is made from dukkha, from imperfection and incompleteness; your life is your logic: you do the creative waves, so reasoned and so good, but as your wave or web of reason floats around, through each possible consequence: each mistake is birth of enemy. Instead of Faith, belief in principle, you got beliefs: as you believe particular realities, even perfection, this fundamental mistake hides deeper and deeper.

Enemies surrender by their free will: logical mistakes do even less. Yet, they become powers of reality, within their own right. Instead of getting rid of them, they appear as ghosts: these vibrations are so hidden that you won't see them; if you try to resolve mathematics by impossible constraint - perhaps you have seen, the constraint is like betrayer, it appears in hidden forms (see typical solutions to Halting paradox).

Rather than overcoming the limits of your enemy: logical mistakes, past perfections (and there was time when surrender was not discovered), become vibrations in reality. Vibrations align with this reality - only by giving an experience, and repeating it in often softening forms, but perhaps with less and less exceptions, where they come as full mistakes ..Nature does not hide away, but lets them come closer in this sense. This is not your victory, but your complex character, which has to appear: rather than changing the outside world, where even mistakes exist in their purified essences, and live their rightful lives; Buddhist gets annoyed, irritated, disgusted by this - but then, they need to get to the right mind. External consequences are for you not to conquer, unless they are having the seed to be conquered so much, now and then; rather, even in this reality: you must find the limitless being in yourself, the ability to win with it.

How can these things even be won? Buddhism is not without the solution: while this might be your initial favourite, the completely perfect world; in each case it's a solution you accept by conquer and surrender, by yin and yang; as you float into what reality is, where it resists, and you let it grow and radiate the light, where it absorbs and lets you live, you complement the two polarities in you: life and death. Through this, your mind surrenders to logic, the soil, while it grows the ethics inside, to become limitless in accepting the border: the plant and it's fruit.

If you eat from the plant of Good and Bad: in this essence to discover something given, like a base principle there where there is only a fluctuation, you do not know that it does not follow a reason. The total sum of causes and effects is far from reason - it's a high complexity, where you have to find, where to surrender and where to win.

This way, you won't cultivate false strength: instead of creating an ideal reality here and now, we become adepts of one: we don't follow only the path of God, but we respect the Satan, the Spirit, which is either the False or it's Solution: for it being the false, it needs to resolve itself rather than you resolving it; for being the solution for the false: in it's solution, you cannot walk rigidly on it's way. Thus, a religion does not ask so much about the *final purpose* of each person, to discriminate the good and bad: it also resists in the realm of forms, and gives each form it's proper fruit and seed; in this material world, we avoid, but we learn from the experience.

# Notice

I have seen remarks that such criticism is falsely attributed. The people seem to feel the personal insult, but then it's better to overcome it or to explain the reasons. Otherwise: we are talking about high ethical guidelines, and these problems are visible in our lives: please, do not come with your tiny ethics, rewards and punishments.
