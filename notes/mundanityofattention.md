# Mundanity of Attention

Attention, our holy vehicle of Mind, is a key system for alignating ourselves to reality. Visualization, then, is mere creation of artificial models of reality - a tool to create a vague imagination there, where the real awareness will shine.

Attention, then, is seen as a miracle or a mystical force to guide us, a Godly power: with this, it might not be visibe that attention is natural to us, inborn, and part of ordinary human abilities.

We see primitive people training high levels of Attention to notice their ground, surroundings, and signs. While this might be associated with Shamanism, such basic training of it was rather in hands of every single person, who might not have cultivated the virtues of Shamanism into such an end that I would have become equal to religion or science - rather, a common peasant-soldier of the primitive men had to keep the stance, awareness of surroundings and an instant response of an "Enlightened Mind".

We see gentlemen, whose whole guide is attention to details; to learn and engineer; and attention to women, men and children. While being mostly Christian, this was not just a mere religious practice, but rather a simple, thoughtful decision about life: a will of thought.

Buddhist attention, generally, is not a will of thought, but a will of Mind. Minding other people, still, is a common, non-religious quality of many people we find in books of many centuries, and it did not require any special skill or prerequisite in addition to paying attention and responding responsibly.

Though this, I have seen this pain and anxiety: if this Way is going to guide me anywhere higher, then why I am rather relying on common human sense than a magic?

We can draw close to mathematics of Attention, even simulate "beings" with different types to Attention: with an Artificial Intelligence Simulation or even that of common Machine Learning, and with knowledge preceding the current, more sucessful wave of an A.I., we get the very same traits we notice in life: if we program a creature to survive this emulated, unconscious environment, their Attention Needs and exercise of efficient strategies would be the very same with ours.

Living in this mundane world, we are approaching enlightenment with same abilities and traits, such as compassion or love, we are executing in the very simplest, natural and naturally available, traits under our command. Even the intent, while a good intent is considered magical - intent itself is our natural tool, even for an evil mind, criminal or absolutely skeptical man.

So we are approaching this Buddhist Path within the limitations of the Human Mind.

This is interesting, because then we notice the signs of progress with non-worldly awe.

Notice the mathematics related to such attention *will* bring our artificial creature to traits of efficiency, without being able to break the basic laws of their artificial world, which could create awe: the feeling about, how so much more is possible. The clarity of Love and Compassion will create them the synergy needed to build a Civilization or Religious Harmony of Life, and to flow past obstacles whether they hurt them or not.

Notice we are moving the very axes of mind noticeable by Natural Laws, things we project into physics, mathematics, chemistry and philosophy or metaphysics. In our analysis of those, the feeling of going to higher frequencies and Heavenly Sphere appears: this Heaven on Earth, Heaven in our Minds, but also the Heavenly State of Where We Are Approaching To, is natural.

## Synergy

Training our senses to attention, attention to awareness and awareness to consciousness:
- We use our mundane senses.
- We pay attention to what comes out from them.
- Awareness remains in everywhere attention did point to.
- Consciousness will not be limited to specific attention, but lights undiscovered territories.

Each of these parts would happen in any kind of artificial intelligence without a miracle, but still notice:
- The machine inside, the one able to use attention, will personally and collectively draw new *forces*, which, despite following mathematical laws and natural causes and effects of this artificial reality: up to the limits of ability of those agents or actors to act there, traits of improved benefits appear, and what is considered "good" or "pleasure" in this world, would both arrive and signify the deeper aspects as signs of permanent appearance of this "good" or "pleasure". The limits of Limited Mind would then much be debunked and disappear.

Imagine a mathematical equation system:
- In each equation, A = 0 would solve it, but there are many other possibilities, which do not overlap.
- The solution to the equation system, then, is likely to involve A = 0 as the solution, or part of a bigger solution.

Each equation might be a very different rule, condition or a goal - they are not solved separately, but the overlap in their identity (or that of their variables) creates this boundary to achieve synchronicity with whatever means possible. "A = 0" becomes a symbolic representation of higher law or principle.

Consider the Nature as a mathematical system, where equations resolve condition and the nature is probably happy with it. Abstraction appears: it needs to find conditions common to many different equations, which would resolve many so that the direct meaning disappears. In this system, what is called synchronicity or synergy appears as optimum, heavy efficiency, which implies infinity approximations of Love, Unity or Friendship, or of any long-term plans. Religion Science and Game Theory meet here: God made this machine of calculations, with calculation of life, to be such free, overcoming it's apparent limits of chaotic consistencies: we cannot overcome the natural law, as much as it is what it is, and we easily notice so many parts of it; the awe is only because we are not limited by the natural laws, but by ourselves.

## Notice

This is not to destroy beliefs into supernatural events, but rather to notice that super is no way without. Discover the mathematical awe and love towards of what you found.
