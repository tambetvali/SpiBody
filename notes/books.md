# Books

As the book collection in the root (main folder of this hublet, well, github repo or document tree) contains just enough book about to make you ask questions - but definitely it leaves some important topics open. Here is the result of my search for such books - I do not want to give exactly the books I've read, but rather it aligns with my developed metaphysics, for example while I have not all the power, each piece of equipment or even all definitions of each term so easily to do all of the Mantak Chia - I can still verify that what he has to say about brain training, connections between muscles and organs, possibility for training the bones, inclusive approach to ass, genitals - like doctors we would name each organ, which is for us and by our will not guilty in anything except weakness and bad health -; well his interest to healing teeth, as the interest of healing each organ, is also what I share; I have different set of exercises, where I can describe the principles, but as him I share the idea of mental control over the subject of an exercise. Thus, his program with researched risks and dangers, illustrations for positions and generalization to exercises, which can be spoken of more or less as the same for different people and body types; my subject of exercise is more philosophical in sense of modern science - but the principle, as scientific, is to follow your intuition, and in Chinese, especially Taoist, Buddhist and Confusianist if not some hidden church, do have a history of intuition, if we so call the oracle visions of the sages, masters, teachers and for each name this conception has got in the fractal of cultural theorems - back then, we got shamans, and the alchemists and magicians started to step towards modern civilization soon after.

## Avicenna, Michael E. Marmura - The Metaphysics Of The Healing-Brigham Young Univ Pr (2005)

Well this is an Islam book and "unluckily" you can learn arabic with this - perhaps you need to cut off the right sides of the pages and add a correct content index in case it's not working for you as well; perhaps you want to learn some of the most important terms, as with Sanskrit or Chinese - the latter happens easily in books referenced as sources for you. My source books for any background and a lots of inspirations, it's very cluttered and there are many, where a book gave me one or two important sentences - books I refer here contain a good collection of those anyway, perhaps in more general form, as I have specifically searched for books, which fit my own philosophy: for example, covering all the topics. You could follow the authors and mentioned people as well.

To feel the glory of Arab Emirates, actually the khalifates if I spell it properly: for us it's similar to egipt mysteries, if you look from the history - but with eventual wars between some of our nations at some periods; for greece it's also part of their imperial history, with interesting story of their later developments, and where it's also interesting, what happened back then: what was going on in Greece. Did this include specific mysteries they would now remember, well among the recordings of any chaos or war on the same territory, but if we follow the quality of medicine and magic, like Sufis?

# Magic Numbers, Planetary Tones and the Body: The Evolution of Daoist Inner Alchemy into Modern Sacred Science by Michael Winn

Well, it's 42 page text so it's quite introduced by the title.

# Physical Immortality: A History and How to Guide (Or how to live to 150 Years and Beyond) By Martin K. Ettington

Well we do not know much about 150 years and beyond, we don't know anything so certain, but let's involve some philosophy:
- In legends about exercises of the immortal, we could find exercises for longer life, with their kind of "logical" end conclusion. Where else we could find these recordings the Chinese culture has? The "immortality" is not just an absolute unit, but living two times longer would already stretch closer to this - we would not die for some time. If 90% of the exercise would stretch the life span, and 10% is mythical, but safe exercise, which logically takes this scenario to the end - we cannot say that such fantasy is without basis; you find the picture worth 1000 words - yogi Trailanga Swami has joints so strong that bone muscles completely overcome the joints, which I would call a holistic body if all the rest is similar to the muscle structure. Hands seem very long, which means he definitely has the fingers trained even in part of the palm, where they are already connected under the same skin - by such hand training, organism and all the organs are already affected. Neck is big, and most of this is the brain muscle, including V-shaped area under the neck, which would be bigger than left and right side muscles of it, where it competes in stages in size - the V-shaped muscle is under the bones, so when you develop this you have also to open / break the bones to get this structure fittingly big; where the muscle on left and right are above the bones and relating to exterior world; with neck that big it's possible to contain the brain-body muscle connection, which gives you a set of intelligent muscles, which do not need your intellectual thought too much to already work - the wrist connecting palm and the rest of the hand provides hands a separate intelligence to further automate the job. Without very conscious legs, one could hardly be immortal (i.e. long-lived, perhaps they wont connect to past, and they won't connect to physical matter or ground; also, the muscle is weaker without leg control to keep it firmly in commanded positions by it's brains) - well and the amulet looks quite nice :) Noah looks like having a tiny amount of neanderthalian blood, sometimes reflecting in something about the top of the head.

Well it continues with mythical immortals; "immortals" who lived to 100-110 years are perhaps the most confirmed in this book, as it mentions.

# The Science of Immortality by Professor Michael J. Cholbi

This is the 5-million science experiment for collecting the future potential of science of immortality; for example, a scientific process could turn you into an immortal in some future.

I always ask this about interaction with machine, for example if teleportation machine would destroy me into atoms and create, in another place, a new body from other atoms, duplicating my structure very precisely: if this happens, am I alive? If you eat a painkiller, and a mental painkiller - are you alive under the effect, and do you vibrate many layers of life?

## The Shaman's Body: Arnold Mindell

Well here you find philosophy about ancient conceptions, such as the hunter and the hunted.

## SHAMAN - An International Journal for Shamanistic Research; Volume 1

You find a collection of work to have "neutral" or "scientific" aspects of the Shamanism. Some have scientifically neutral tone, some are inspired by Taoism or Chinese mythology, such as the hidden city - what it was (built) for?

# The Tao 道 of the Wu 巫: Shamanism Meets Taoism; Integrating Shamanistic Principles and Taoist Witchcraft

From the 39 page book:

Step into the mystical lineage of the Wu 巫 shamans, ancient spiritual intermediaries whose practices shaped the roots of Taoist magical traditions. We will reach far back in to history and explore the cultures of the Yellow River to extract first principles that will be useful to any practice of core shamanism. Drawing a clear evolutionary line from 3,000-year-old records of shamanism to contemporary Taoist witchcraft, we’ll reveal how these ancient traditions of the Wu have been refined and preserved within Taoist magical systems. Wu shamanism and Taoist witchcraft offer a timeless, dynamic pathway to reconciling the seen and unseen worlds, empowering you to live in alignment with the Tao.

Whether you are a seasoned practitioner or a curious seeker, a mystic or an academic, this lecture gives clear and easy insights into East Asian mysticism that are otherwise hard to find in the English language.

# The Way of the Golden Elixir - An Introduction to Taoist Alchemy

Waidan and Neidan - Neidan, as you might have noticed, talks about bones and teeth and thus must be of my special interest.

# The Way of the Shaman - A Guide to Power and Healing by Michael Harner

This is an anthropologist; they cover human around the world - to be shaman is a human activity, which we remember as a common gene for all humans; later it just developed in parallel.
