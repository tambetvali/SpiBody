# Material and Ideal

In Material realms, Physics controls.

In Ideal realms, Mathematics controls.

In physical-material cycle, our base goals or survivals appear as we contemplate on the cycle of incompleteness.
This is our actual world.

In ideal realms, we reason this material world and everything it has, makes sense in regards to this material world.
However, as it mathematically converges into neutral view, where our's is just one possible reality, and the absolute
scales of the hidden layers of subconscious, to be superconscious appears here. In deep beneath, the algorithm might
have chosen or evolved or created and invented, by creative beings appearance: who, clearly, must have strong adaptility
though condition change the material elements might not have. We as beings are but a physical manifestation of this.

So as we invent the ideal worlds: so must do the base math. In here, we are ideal beings born into this material realm,
which is the possible one, and perhaps we choose from several possible ones - we can re-engineer our minds for additional,
virtual senses of artificial enlightenment, and once the pattern appears in matter it might start to seem metaphysical,
but then it's ideal only for the future. We are beings born into this realm, but as we are alive - our intellectual or
spiritual centers align that we look neutrally, for condition of many materials being possible; we kind of travel something
metaphysical and we are able to be born whatever the matter is: if we generalize above ego, our metaphysical existence
in any possible reality. If we have ego, this particular reality appears, but we have some higher ego in deeper essence,
where we purify the good and bad aspects, locally and globally, being zen and tao to alter the senses and decisions in
change, and in constant fluctuation: from possibility fluctuations and all ends ever open it appears the principle of
emptiness or void, where we rather follow the material course than imply any of our inner ideals. The inner ideals are
still a leading force into the victory; but the material appears in repeated patterns, where negative acceleration
(decceleration) appears so that each missed pattern of matter is negatively accelerated or in my language, it means negatively
deccelerated where both are negations and their values accumulated, not reversed. The values are reversed if one is applied on
another, but we apply both; when one is applied on another, we can find more axes.

Now from this:
- Ideal worlds calculate out from the box of this particular reality and it's particular realities in fractal, and as life
  we find ourselves ideally in this neutral realm or observer, participiating in creation of this reality in it's particular
  terms of life. We conquer this reality as neutral beings, by our higher chakras, and we as Selves are able to serve
  multiple realities, innately being immortal but perhaps not connected in this changing nature of self: we are born even
  in abstract realities, and in many paradigms of this: in much higher scale than what the shaman can change, the personal
  consciousness or model of I/O (senses and willpatterns in relations to models and imaginations, or rather real experiences
  of proven paradigms: yet different as chakras). Each positive thing we do here, accumulates, giving acceleration to matter
  in both it's positive and negative terms - negative solutions are resolved; the inversation is 1/8 worth in total, like
  full reverse or transcerse in level four; four is our chosen ideal number, 2+2 and 2*2, where 0 and 1 have their next
  ideal point to reflect one interesting octave of velocity and exponent in infinity, as projected into +- and */ scales
  accordingly, with linear gradient of this fractal head topology and dimensions.
- Material worlds create the negation: it gives one unpleasant, yet correct solution of particular fundamental paradigms
  applied onto us; we call this an absolute rather than a fundamental: as it's not any choice or selection, but given
  *a priory* or *self-contained* reality unfolding infinitely in each materialized aspect, but approaching and converging
  in terms of it's ideal approximation of neutral observer - a human, definitely, but also an animal or settled pattern of
  a material or natural force, such as oscillating harmonic, non-destructive vibrations or oscillations of sound and light,
  even physical vibrations and conversions of these elements we can see in matter. We are part of traditions of human body,
  family, soul families or group belongings and archetypes and symbols, even math and logic: logic is meant to be neutral
  to our world, as we need to measure, in which world we are and it might not know, in our language, on it's own. Perhaps
  it knows more natural patterns, such as oscillations and "never-repeating" snow-flakes which appear to have ideals: they
  have no given form, but they create a metaphysical system to understand even wild possibilities of 6-cornered shapes and
  3-cornered failures (non-personalization), perhaps 12-cornered syndromes (differentiation, individuation).

I give relations of how human person relates to soul or societial effects of their body parts, such as chakras and meridians.
Marcus Aurelius is one of medievial philosophers to show the other way around: how various parts of society are reflected
in our human body by essential structures of itself. The structures can be converted from one essence to another, such
as wide-spread personal abilities versus general infrastructure in each matters.

Telespectrive realms also appear: cases where we interact about our condition with physical realities. Given our biologic
systems are well reflective and senseful of their activities, we do not know the condition for such thing to appear -
given our brain parts create synapsis and grow in their fractal relations with other parts, systems of all the senses
give us illustratory or virtual-reality appearance, and with our motor systems and sensory systems in work, and philosophical
doubt aligned with material, spiritual and scientific playfulness or curiosity, this virtual reality is rather real. I do
agree that by neutonian physics, many extrasensory sources become rather unexplainable and not scientific, but this appears
to be our most trivial sensation of reality, of it's material bodies; quantum physics does not deny that the matter we
consist of, is not restricted, in all the cases, to remain local in time and space, even relative reflections in time and space
and their ever-lasting nature.

The entropy is growing over time, and with given mass and energy in the universe, the information bits are added with constant
speed or velocity, various effective factors of qualities: where those finite quantities vary, somewhere in center of gaussian
average of such variance is the quality, the effect they actually provide as measured towards infinity, in zone of
uncountability.
