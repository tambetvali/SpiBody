# Arguments of God and Intuition

Notice that I am using arguments of God and Intuition: I am often talking about those.

Argument of God does not involve superstitions: I have not used this argument to convince you in something in lack of argument, but my argument is as follows:

God is the Sum of Goodness - the implications into infinity - and Everything above the Major Consciousness - processes, which can be equated with consciousness-like properties, such as converging in infinity, ones of society or time, and concluding the "ends" of karmic effects: notice that this is *empty*, the infinity does not have an end, but rather it continues into imaginary direction. From this argumentation you can imply:
- Basis of theorem: that it still continues in any degree of infinity, always yielding truth.
- Basis of eternity: that it still continues in any degree of infinity, always surviving.

We can say it's *the same principle* in those.

While in my late argumentation I am more sure that this ultimate vibration could produce a harmonic vibration in our conscious plane, and that the rays into mathematical realms end up in our visible realms: this Mind as ready to reincarnate as us; especially we can see the high frequencies in all kinds of creatures and events, including intuitions.

My argument, if we equate God, also in good tradition of Word of Christ - which is why I use exactly these words:
- We do a mathematical implication about these infinite consequences, and the results we call will of God: for example, we can say *ethics itself* is inside this scope; we can usually conclude ethics as complying with Argument of God, since it appears in infinity. We know in case of existance of Good and Bad, the Active Good is very probable to Win, and if it does not - it will win the probabilities:
 - In evolution, we assume survival of the fit ("fit": the ultimate fit with fundamental laws and other creatures, eventually, yields a circular and right definition circulating around ethics).
 - In business, we assume competitive results from having each end connected with each end (basis of karma).

If you say Power and Truth in ultimate sense - Power is that it would imply; and Truth is that it's in coherence with that which is Natural, such as the Natural Laws: you have said "God". This is kind of empty definition of God.

Now notice: once you are coherent in this argument of God, you can learn about it's causes and effects, and about delusions and illusions. Delusions and illusions: more often than not, as a Viking, I see those as natural causes as well, for example the wholeness around us might not involve Power and Truth: a False God appears. It represents the Stupidity and real Weakness, but it also represents the intents of Weak and Stupid people: as much as we forgive and take care, as much we need to take an appropriate care with those creatures, since the "equal rights" of people also involve "equal rights" of spirits appearing from such unconsciousness: mere fighting or escaping is usually not a solution, but might leave you be an ignorant or superstitious person, who believes the Truth can be established in one step. Viking does not ask whether it's logical that this person attacks me - yes it is, definitely, logical and one should not break in this "illogical condition"; the conflict is rather logical: it might be nothing more, but it's logical. This means you need to have stable thought over conflict situations, and you don't necessarily need to see that "everything is broken", but you need to have a certain flow - the flow could end up with broken rib, but you have done just more than in losing your faith in that special moment.

Intuition:
- Normally, it's the intuitive sense of truth: you develop one through your lifetime, but essentially, for metaphysical law - such as seeing truth in logic itself;
 - the intuitions about life and it's events are purified by experience.

While I have intuition, I was telling - while in soft science, we see the failure of logic after many years (such as police being paranoid that somebody might be a criminal, and failing the constitution where there is none; or a house cleaner stealing your shampoo because they do not understand the value of sciences); in hard science, the compiler is telling you the mistake right away: I started to be a programmer, because the computer is telling me about my mistakes, and I get that good strategy of contemplating fully on this. I would see my mistakes every day.

Intuition and God: after one has gone through all the scientific contemplation:
- They are closer in trusting their Visions.
- I do listen to people, who have these Videos of Will of God: I am kind of thankful if I can confirm this with science.

We see the poor witch and believer of old times - the low-class sensitive, often, lacks the scientific clarity. While they used to yell about the dangers and sometimes feared the people, in modern world they appear somewhat dumb right away - I do not see any actual danger. When they hear about climate problems, suddenly they yell that the world would end if you use this unhealthy product - well this is kind of excitement for understanding anything at all.

# Christians and others

Notice that based on my secular argument of God, I can very well follow the arguments of Christ - the Good and Bad, Historic Peak or Apocalypsis (either a long process or short event of evolution to become "enlightened", such as commonly accepting the laws of karma and becoming non-returner).

Moreover: with eastern images of single gods, images of multiple gods, images of no-god: each finds it's place. It's very important to contemplate: what is discussed in each instance, and in which aspect of paradigm it's true: for example, an Atheist might walk into realm with no God.
