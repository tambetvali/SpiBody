So you can view this all as a 3-step process or program:

1. Meditate physically, which can be called body awareness meditation or somatic meditation:

Lye down, and sense all your bodily, physical sensations. Start from inner world, over time - extend to outer world. This means to observe your body, with attention, until you become more aware and conscious of it. For each method, which you apply to meditate on Mind - meditate, the same, on Body.

2. Heal yourself:

Meditate on tensions, pains, etc. on your body: keeping awareness there, "catching" the pain, making it conscious. Be gentle: too much force or effort might distract your process. Once the awareness is on pain or tension, it initially grows bigger - you are not hiding it -, but it's also a healing process. Attention on your tension or pain brings multiple levels of healing.

3. Exercise what you feel:

The meditation brings you closer to your body - helping you to be aware of it, to move it, and to respond to it's needs. Use this to training it in more deeper ways - your intent is moving what you feel, your senses are more sensitive to risks and possibilities, to natural flow of your exerice.

Notice, as in Buddhist meditation: the real Wisdom is inside you, and the meditation methods could get you in contact with this, rather than needing extensive amounts of knowledge. While communication, indeed, is good part of life: you can notice, by practicing these 3 steps properly, you get a solid inflow of experience, thus it's solution - energy.
