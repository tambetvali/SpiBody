# Health, Longevity, Immortality

- **If This Is Happening to You, Your Quantum Jump Is Closer Than You Think** - think whether the events in this video remind you of death and rebirth.

These three are interestingly related conceptions, because:

Is *aging* natural, or is it a combination of problems and diseases, which some aspect of Nature is trying to avoid? If it is intentional - is this a general reason, or are we having a specific mental problem cured by death, in nature and natural selection?

We can watch aging and illness, which appears as we live. To live longer, or to live shorter, but better life (what quantifies as life, or what qualifies as life) - is aging just a collection of health problems?

Zen of immortality: indeed, Zen is not seeking, and it lets go. We let go the absolute desire to live; we make our life and death more easy to others.

Naturally, practices of immortality would be very dangerous, if *solely* for that, or if we would run for them with too much intensity. Dropping this altogether, might be the unhealthy solution.

"Material immortality" is sometimes seen as extending one's life span. Spiritual immortality, as unifying the life and death cycles - I would also add, with different sizes of infinity itself, the infinite cycle of life and death can be with very different density: while physical death does not fear me, and Zen would be to think: who is feared by physical death, would never get immortality - rather than seeing it as abstract reason or ideal, we should analyze the reasons of life, death, health and health problems and seek for the most natural solution; only the fear of unknown, not any kind of good factual basis of life quality, would make us *definitely* yield and slip for immortality.

Still the concept of health consists of:
- The life span: how long we live
- The life quality:
  - Positive qualities: which years would be worth ten years?
  - Negative qualities: which ten years would be worth one year?

Looking of these variables - how long it takes, and how good or bad is the experience -, we know some of the direct pleasure of it.

Then, we need to resolve ethical matters - deeper qualities, which might connect us to big picture.

In senses, where immortality is good - just view this quality as length+quality combination, achievable in lower or higher degree; a synergy of health and survival.

For me the real thing: I was watching the future lifetimes, calculating and imagining (my math is even able to calculate this directly, based on several expectations): what I really want to do is to align with the idea that I do not spend so much, but I earn so much, to create the karma of infinite, raising lifetimes; where it's not necessary to separate them all into separate lives. But in some situations, understanding that you will be born again, able to create new genes and designs of you, might split eternal lives eventually.

Immortality is not a dark concept: it's good.
- Rather than being pained with such good concepts; let's be pained by people, who do not remain calm in situations of fears and hopes.

To help others in immortality:
- To find out more and to help others to understand.
- To receive their help.
- To produce health and longevity on each your step, not just a life quality inside a window you don't control at all.

Looking at aging and it's explanations, and without being ready to give away each unhealthy habit for such a chance - I would like to be immortal with *normal* life, not some drastic rigid "perfect health stance"; rather there is balance between things, which spend us and make us tired, and things, which earn back and make us relaxed.

Lately, in me, I have convincingly solved several sickness related to aging:
- Old people have pain in joints.
- Old people have disabilities in brain.
- I had chronic diseases, which get worse over time.

Well it's not a direct jump to immortality - rather, all these things could be trained; for example, now with trained, but not overtrained joints, I just could reason: there *was* a reason to get pain into joints.

The question is: if I join many enough of such health cycles, and the excess health already starts to accumulate into leaving energy to solve other health problems: living longer, and keeping longer youth - there is also the "eternal youth" concept to discern possibity of long, but undesireable life - the latter I did not mean, but I would rather be born again than being a typical 90 year old man of today for two million years.

I just see fractals and cycles of problems: each problem creating more and more problems; and solutions, where getting rid of one problem or getting strength into one part avoids many problems.

If death does not have a *special cause related only to death and not into accumulation of health problems*, we could research whether this is natural cause to be followed in good karma, or does it turn out to be sickness or pervercy.

This is a natural question:
- Are we dying for accumulated sickness or did nature program death into us, deliberately for no purpose other than death, it's reasoning and *natural selection towards death* instead of *natural selection towards another thing, where death appears as a side-effect*?

In case we are not *programmed for death*, but it's a consequence of many problems:
- We achieve that health, longevity and immortality blend so closely into one problem that we cannot seriously solve one, without working on other.

# Materials on Aging

Free books you could download (search for free PDFs):

*Handbook of Theories of Aging - Springer Publishing Company* (Third Edition: **830 pages**).

*Senescence, the last half of life* by Hall, G. Stanley (Granville Stanley), 1844-1924: 556 pages.

You could search for:
- Aging as pathology.

You could analyze aging, especially each problem of health: as we get over those problems, which remains as cause of death? If it's seen "natural": could it still be seen as some kind of pathology?
- At the same time, yin: for each hint to *purposeful* aging, such as enabling evolution: how to surrender properly, and also find the solutions where the purpose is met without such sacrifice? Buddhism teaches about this: you should contemplate on each argument of Buddha, where aging is natural. Then - what is the permanence, and where it's natural, and when would you align to this natural cause only if it exists?

It is: a quest to understand aging, each thing which makes us less filled with quality life.
