# Social Communication - Sides

When your financial, social, institutional relations fall off - you feel pain on your sides, two sides of the body. You have to train your sides.

For hand: biceps is initially located on top (front) and there is another muscle on bottom (back). When you train your hands for side movement, you finally feel parts of biceps on sides of your hand and they start to grow: the side muscle system is connected and united on the whole body.
