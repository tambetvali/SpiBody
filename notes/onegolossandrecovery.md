# Ego Loss and Recovery

This targets the following:
- LSD
- Egoless meditations

You can see in certain developments to overcome your ego, you can lose it very completely. Notice that it could be advantageous in development of your higher energies, but the actual success can come only in visible world: ideals are perfect in essence, but the real thing about them is only their materialization - this comes from their nature, to contemplate on the material world, such as peace, help, humanity..

Without training the physical, you reach a high vision of ideal states in some aspect or sense; through your work on the means - body, engineering, particular details of implementation, you build a vehicle. It's a control center without vehicle: as such, it slowly fades away, because the ideal relations for example for success, prosperity and miraculous flows; they remain in kind of distance; each will appear in your life as a possibility, but you cannot meet it's ends - it's like a devil in play, where you are given money and money, but it turns into leaves and the leaves.

This ideal world prospers, where there are actual means to implement it: and by gathering the means, you see obstacles.

Material world is negative: the whole material principle, for your mind, seems like overcoming a grand obstacle. As you solidify in material world, you get into this initially annoying routine of doing the material things. This obstacle needs to be transcended: this world does not mean what it might seem, to replace it with something else; rather, by assuming each of these obstacles into your mental template, you get the negative force to eliminate false solutions - this starts building the process of right. In this essence you are yin, yielding, and the matter itself is that; it's the responsibility, duty, the prison where you do not get out, but you have to cope inside.

The mental world is positive: the whole ideal principle is built on tracking those material features to the end, and finding an internal contradiction in following them completely, but locally; you see as it reflects the real forces, it's a real force itself. Changes and changes in each material situation wobble this out of material, mundane existance, where it needs to be ready of change - then, it raises above the natural law, rather reflecting each natural law, which can exist.

In your training, then, you find a need for your Ego - a higher version of it, which *does not* distract you from your *mental* journey in *eternity*, a deeper change meant to be fluid and straight in this yielding situation. The material world will get you into new and new situations of new and new needs, even what seems a basic law, will change as you get deeper - this ideal world appears out of those changes, until they turn into their ideal form; in the realm of certanties and uncertanties, thus philosophy and science, you reach a limit value which could conceive *any* change, and where anything is possible - anything could become to be, and thus the metaphysics brings you to causes and effects where there seems to be a solid reality, what is like given set of true and false facts, never changing or interacting, never causing each others inside time; in this eternity, they have complex logic of causes and effects.

As you lost your ego: contemplate on each pain and lack, and discover that your natural functions to keep you up are still needed; you cannot be a yielding thing building a firm world, a man in fall still dreaming right and effectively in that, which needs to be raising ..moreover, you cannot be raising *with people like you*, but you need workers, peasants, many other people you could become into. You need constant experience to bring the corrections to your ideals.

So you need to rebuild the automatic part in you, which brings you to equilibrium, once you have destroyed your ego; once you have walked these hermit / monkly paths and do not gain from them so much any more; you see how much the material skills helped you.
