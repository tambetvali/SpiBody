# Training episodes

I describe some generic exercises and developments.

Most easily, two joints are connected by 3D connection:
- First dimension: left-right.
- Second dimension: up-down.
- Third dimension: rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.

You can add two dimensions, combining the first and second - involve the diagonals so that you have eight directions; you can raise this number and optimize with random algorithm of doing movements in all directions. Indeed you can rotate and move the same time.

I trained heavily one period, until my body was broken - it had to grow larger bone structure for most parts of my body, especially around the root chakra; so, for example, it was very tricky to walk and I had to use help of hands to stand up. This period was one or two years: later, as muscles started growing, I replaced this with simpler exercise - the muscle growth is delayed to now, and I do simple exercises with each, which arrives. I do not want to suggest the hard part here, because this needs planning of your life and life of the others, to not do it all the same time. I was kind of aware that it will come - thinking, now I break it all, and later I don't have to do it again. This is like "reengineering" - you do not do it too much. When it was broken, I did grow a back-up set of muscles to avoid such losses in training.

The hard part mainly differed by this: I learnt to control two directions of each dimension separately, and instead of using any masses, mostly contracted the opposite muscle as much as much obstacle force I needed. I am sure the easy exercise works without preparation, especially if you are happy with your bone structure - the matter is, they simply have to fit inside.

My hand exercise is the following:
- Positions of hands (bold ones are the ones I do more often):
 - In front: **low**, **middle**, high, left, center, right.
 - On both sides: **low**, middle, high.
 - In back: **low**, **middle**, high, **left**, center, **right**
- Each of these positions needs palm training separately:
 - Circles of wrists.
 - Circles of thumb: it has 3 parts, and it's important to train the first and second part.
 - Eventually, do combinations of fingers for short time.
- Positions of fingers:
 - Mostly either closed or open: those two positions are the most primitive.

Meridians:
- Left and right side, center of front-back direction: move forth and back, and rotate hand by 90 degrees - move into what is forth and back now. Hand-level, wrist-level, or thumb-level: find that they are on the same meridian, so if you align them and move each front or back at the same time, when they pass the meridian is dependent on their sum, the collective effort or stretch tension. Here you also switch between back and chest muscle to control your hands, so the middle position is important even if the bone crack moves away, as it does more stretch.
- Also, if hands are 90 degrees to your body, straight left and right, you find meridians up and down, left and right.
- Small meridians of fingers exist in each position: but as they stretch, the same cracks change positions.

Each of these exercises should find the cracks in your hand bones: you move over position, where you have to crack the bone. Do this repetitively, until you get it free for once; now, each time you do it, you get it free quite fast - later, unless the bone is tired, the move over this area is free.

Once you crack the main bone, it has muscle but no tissues: the muscle is very one-directional. You should not go over several cracks like this, because you can move in, but moves in any random direction can be too painful. Once you open (crack) your bone, or even before it: do many-directional moves around it, and pass the area of crack in many directions, which might or here prefferrably also might not crack themselves; they can be smooth. Do this to grow tissues and the whole muscle around, because you need to train the whole complexity of movement instead of one, so that you do not have labyrints, which could move you into dangerous - completely untrained - positions.
- Once you get rid of obstacles, like cracks and centers of main meridians or dimensions, where you either crack bones or replace the directional muscles, these movements should become firm, effortless and as they do not overcome obstacles - the same activities take less moves (so you move from fast hip-hop to slower epic / classic music, such as violin like Lindsey Stirling, who moves quite well compared to me). Smooth movement is also faster, because you do less moves and overcome less obstacles, which also need thinking in your internal system - so, without much added inertial forces or non-tact movements, which could for example create waves in your coffe cup, or a storm, you still gain the activities done faster, in turn you like them more until they start giving energy.

For fingers:
- Intention is very important: take care, for wrist and thumb exercise, that you also put effort to the muscle reaching your two smaller fingers. Little finger initially might lose it's apart-stretched position by so weak push that it's almost a touch, and for thumb it's later easy to take 90 or more degrees of angles, while initially it might prefer 45 degrees - you have to train the part under skin, the third one from top of the finger, to do circles well.
- Eventually, try different moves of wrist and thumb, sometimes in different positions of fingers, and always in different positions of hands, even body and legs.
- This exercise, as it's low-effort and very long, with many repetitions: once a series gets tired, don't stop it, but do *other nearby moves* or *same moves with other hand* - this means, something deeper is going to get tired, which is rather your strength to keep living than strength for particular thing in life; strength for work rather than *complete* routine. So, while strength of one muscle runs out, the strength of a muscle group or complex can be trained much more - for example, for rotations, change direction every time you get tired.

As they are low-intensity exercises, don't count them: you get tired, and could happily spend some time at area where muscle already feels it's death - for this area, practice body awareness meditations first and get your healing meditations (awareness of tensions and pains) in such smooth state that it does not bring it's own tension, which is also able to break something. Notice the healing is very trivial in the beginning, but you learn complex movements of will (and body), and same goes for sensing, the body awareness - initially you just feel your body parts or the whole (I lost ability to sense the whole as a child, and recovered the adult version much later - for a child, the sensible body is much more compact and the energy can be kept high without danger; as adult or old, your regenerative abilities of body, as well as ability to keep and recharge the energy needs to be high; with childish effort alone, you would break your body in various ways - it's now strong, so you need more old-man's exercise; despite this, many exercise-like things children do are very low-effort, compared to adults, and I think my exercise is fine to do with children). Without counting, you do different counts for both hands / sides - this is very good, because you sense them separately; when one side gets much stronger, you might feel pain - balancing this pain and achieving stability in long cycles creates more robust effort than simply counting to the same number, which is a very machine-like method; as well your body, not the intelligence and ability of hands are symmetric, and thus you need to create different exercises - moreover, for more complex moves, often you cannot do *exactly* the same thing with other hand, from life it does not know how to do it, and the path to equal hands could be very long and complex (in process, you would learn to write equally well with both hands).

Movements are not happening in 3D space, but in symbolic space:
- You do not mind if you cannot do each position combined with each position: fingers, seen as one couple of two couples (4 fingers) making another couple with thumb - for example, you can move left 2 in regards to right 2 quite freely, but you cannot be so free to move the main two fingers in very different directions. Notice this kind of thing is not overcome very strongly - you are interested in more flexibility, but you follow the complex engineering of hand, and trust it has many abilities despite of these things, which seem as obstacles in 3D view - instead of 3D view, in symbolic view, each movement means something, and is able for many things, and the 5 fingers together are able for many things.
- The whole muscle from 2 smaller fingers, to the same side of hand well up, and continuing even to legs, is very weak; once you get those fingers trained - and you need a lot of thumb training to get their biggest couple free in their marriage, and to create the brain of the palm, which is in wrist - each of the exercises described somehow affects aspects of the wrist.

The same time with hands, the exercise will slowly reach foot, to create pain there as well. You can also take pain from other people, who might need your work - perhaps through heart or something, multiperson groups would feel all the pains and shames for muscle growth, or especially for the intent to exercise :)

I would suggest to create simple synchronized movements as well with other people: your muscles feel their movements as potentials, and through combined exercise you could create united muscle pains, where your disposition with other people already starts to grow your muscles - this also involves feeling of lack of exercise at the right places, as we see it multifrequentially, in mind and body (matter).

Exercise your legs as well, especially the parts related to parts you exercise for fingers - do it sometimes, for a while, if you are concentrated on fingers. Do some whole-body exercise, and especially: exercise each part which grows or feels pain and shame after you train the fingers - this, for example, creates the muscle memory and initial ability to make you automatically involve them in later exercise, as you have some initial experience - your body is more interested.
