# Exercise for disabled people

_Subtitle: for cumulative effect of little raise of effectiveness of all the disabled people, or all the life of one._

In my life of poverty, and I'm hardly motivated of money with less ethical value - such as being raised into the relations, which already start to debunk -, I have seen disabled people, who have limited muscle movement or unopened bones. Perhaps they have lost a hand.

We see olympic games of disabled people, or movies of their heroic victories (Jennifer Lopez). For most of the practical purpose, the sport on top, for any other of us, should remove our limits - showing them running, smiling and living, the ones who lost what we need almost _a priori_ -; it removes not the limit of our unconscious growth, but it puts the disabled people into the average of society - where they feel the top as really still breaking the barriers, they feel a healthy amount of exercise would not put them into top 1%; where they see people, who exerice heavily and succeed, they would hope to get something out of their 5 minutes exercise per day. For example, without billionaires, we would fear to hope to earn a million with hard work and development of skills and relationships; if only a couple of people would make just a million, the gaussian curve would leave others to realistically think they could earn a few.

Disabled people, for example those who are limited to small amounts of movements, who hardly walk, sit down and eat: if they use their limited movement wisely, they would look serious and the fact that they reflect the condition of idiot, would reflect the planning and complexity or success of movement, which appears from their physical condition; with less abilities, your solutions seem simpler.

Me myself - for my physical condition is but a side-effect of longing for health and ability, and I did choose the way of an intellectual, even if now I can see there is not much to intellectualize; in this development of my mind, from age of 10, to age of 30, to have really long meditations, analyzes, solutions for theoretical problems and knowledge of sciences, religions and even exercise, I had to cut down some earthly decisions - of my genetics, nationality or people I like, I do not have stable and balanced strength of physical abilities necessary to show classical human condition each case, rather, for example, I do not catch a ball as well as most people I can see, and even with people I could put down if use of every muscle is allowed - I cannot put their hand down, because I really use my back and not biceps, as required in version of this competition as taught to me, even if the opponents fail to strictly follow this. My shoulders and back are far stronger than my biceps, and I use them more to lift a weighty thing or put force into my work with hands. Even the pushups are lately, slowly, moving to the body muscle even if the pressure in hands, legs and the body used to be separate; once I succeed in easily doing them more than 10 in a row, probably the tension is simply all over the body and I still would not get much effort to biceps - overall, after exercising flexibility, I cannot get full force into the biceps and the case of moving the hand does not create the reflection of force any more, such as the biceps going any bigger only from this movement. Heavy work to target each muscle with proper exercise would change this condition quite easily, but the relation of biceps and shoulder just reflects an anatomy textbook and seems to create the conception of a "human" - I rather fear to lose my health if I have markers for physical condition of muscle, which can be created with such intellectually simple exercise.

For now, the situation is changing - at age 30 I started to experience the call of life; from age six I would have read tens of thousands of books and manuals, and I started to feel the deep books are repeating; learning just another similar thing is less than my own creativity, where the models are actually well-known. At age 40 the INTP would, in case of steady development, start to develop secondary functions of ENFJ, but without losing the scientific precision or the fruits of religious and spiritual speculations on each side: at this point, let's compare me with disabled people; the balanced, realistic development of body and physics lacked the virtue of freedom, rather a scientist type develops certain skill to meet clarified criteria, and does not work out the position in practical body to connect this with everything to work or to fight; rather the number is proven, about some quantities, and the qualities only become to theoretical base - for ENFJ, the question about how to wash dishes and throw a ball become critical from each experience and they randomly combine little of force of Bruce Lee with some of the other exercise, and with some practice, and achieve exactly the criteria of organizing their life and solving the actual problems with dishes or an actual ball they would use for purpose, for example to develop teamplay and reaching it's life skills.

Disable people do have some strengths - for example, a man who can hardly walk or act, might look serious like adult, live into eating and greeting, recognizing the essential value and blessing the life process or measuring it carefully, and paying attention to such process and recognizing it as a basic life, so to show seriousity and worries, as well as excitement over food, even 3 times a day; they might have strong muscle for it's not easy to countereffect all the random movements affecting their body without their intent; we counteract much less of this physics - but looking my smooth, solid movement without much tricks and effects, sometimes looking unintended, lacking any effort or straight failing because the fluid and much firmer muscle already takes complex activities, which look like an accident; with being use to develop it further and break barriers, I easily do things into a bit higher degree than that which is easy, and this effort looks like I am disabled myself: I do feel disabled and a physical idiot if my development fails for a few days and the movement becomes a routine of certain stage of ability; even restoring from an accident or health problem feels a creative process, and there I could contemplate about disabled people as I look like one - for example, having exercised legs and their related muscle system, I might use the same tricks for walking, and develop the same freedom in them.

In each case, I could see another story of me: compared to which I am disabled, unable to produce stable and constant results in physical world. I am benefitting much of my raised flexibility, but I cannot take positions known well by yogis and in ballet, nor make saltos or have muscle for motocycle extremism. The stars and the politicians: their muscle is at the optimum, for they have a little benefit for the firmness of everyday activities and common work, as well as some hobby or specialization. This provides common health - intellectual or mentally active person, such as a politician - would be young at 40, where a cleaner is already aged at 30; our body is a complex system and we need the intellectual or spiritual effort to manage this complexity or to learn the simple solutions. Similarly, where I have balanced growth, I do not close any particular competition with specialized skill (indeed I am specialized computer engineer and architect, so I would close some competitions of these); a high-class person, without closing the competitions with masters, have a little benefit of intelligence, getting stronger in cumulative effect of time, in their hand movement for each common work, in their expression or the way they keep the body. Most of them avoid intense activities for particular strength, like a single muscle, but rather they try to consistently engage in activities to get to particular purposes without endangering their health; therefore we cannot say exactly, what they are competent in. More brilliant of these, indeed, develop this balanced structure much further - but in each case, where you are progressing, the progress matters and you cannot seek a dead end, such as winning the olympics; others, who do win, even with strong balance of mind, body, spirit - they create the high line in the middle of gaussian curve, and rather get you moving on the edges; you would not do your little exercise if it would be a top of the world, equal to the highest achievement; rather you relate to the top of society in a way a beginner would do.

My personal method of exercise:
- each 6 years, I do something "extreme": perhaps it's 10% effort of some achievement, which actually surprises me; when I see people climbing Mount Everest, perhaps I finally climb my local mountain and it's enough to surprise me. For example, with all the people who jumped down from high mountain and became eagles: finally, I jumped down a series of 4 and 2 meter "walls" (a small mountain, from where the roofs are visible below, to the ground state in steps); I made saltos after ..I did really eat the same plant, for this once, with the people who jump from the bridges - Datura - and it was the shamanistic experience of intuition and body control - but I was Viking realistic in this. Having jumped down, made saltos, catched the land with my hands: well I did not become an eagle, but I became *just something*, having also seen the top sport, where they could actually reach much more than this, sometimes with eventual penalty of death. Well to jump down and gain some control - symbolic as it is, I was simply realistically happy for this (I don't really understand why I should become an eagle, but I do understand that when practiced just once, the body will overcome certain limits and get *me* doing saltos for a day, even if I happily fear this whole thing before and after: a _specialist_ would do this without heavy development). "Two Steps From Hell - Strength of a Thousand Men" - in this music video you can see that Wonder Woman can not fly; she is doing like me: just catching herself to something. No doubt, this is my favourite superhero - bigger than me, but loser of the same kind, leaving me to do 10% of hers :)
- I do have periods of intense training for one or another purpose; for example you can not insult me for a complete lack of important skill for so long - even a Book of the Saints can not do this, I would overcome this.
- I am more and more happy with this: simple, effortless exercise with many repetitions and long periods of routines of similar sets; going through each ability, each part of the body, the practical combinations and more different combinations. Involved, very importantly: there are joints, which move just a few millimeters (well let's not consider the olympics and the masters here!); for example, a thumb has 2 bones exterior from it's tip, but also one bone interior to the palm of the hand: this last bone could be more precisely seen as 2 bones itself, as it can stretch some 1-2 millimeters from the middle short after it's initial developments. You can find number of movements, which are just 1-2 millimeters for visible horizon of balanced growth of the bodily strength (to move) and the movement; foot is full of things, which seem to move so few degrees that they might appear to be just leftover of monkeys - do not think it's just tradition of climbing the trees as the legs and foot need to be physically intelligent to cover the interior condition of massage and exercise as well as the exterior condition of interaction with the ground: for robots, to learn this, it took more than basic algorithms, walking definitely means a robot is able to learn, having some physical and intellectual intelligence. Consider this:
 - If you move your foot only a millimeter, in the other way it would move your body 20 cm.
 - Speaking of parts, the movement is small, but such small-range joints all over the body make the whole-body muscle very flexible, because they interact with the forces non-locally - from legs to fingers, moving each of such joint, you *do* feel the effect, and the vibration you do just to stand is unnoticeable, of similar degree.
 - Thus, this small gain in flexibility is enough to produce visible change into your everyday efficiency, even if it does not give you very measureable new skill (it still looks as if it does, because people are very sensitive to these small tricks and failures, or resets of the positions to start over instead of continuation on the smooth path - ballet dancer, indeed, looks like having extremely slow motion where one another would seem running).
- Close limits: many positions of your body, without training, are a few millimeters away from the *real, firm* positions. To open a door firmly, you would need your hand at 90 degree position, but you have 89; to properly take a service paper to your hand, looking like a book model, you need submillimeter flexibility inside your palm; to massage one hand with another, you also lack 1 degree to have them with full connection, and you fail most of the feeling with this little angle. Without the proper angles, you get the job done, but you are always doing little tricks and mistakes, so that your performance lacks many qualities - just taking diagonal things in front of you with full hand means full contact, firm hold, and a little release or fresh feeling; in any stage of your development, you are "almost there" for whole new feeling of freedom and ability. Gaining 0.1% additional performance for each skill in your whole body will generate exponential growth, exponentially less effort, time and distraction, even exponent of health (if others try to distract you, indeed it also grows your skills: if each thing is against you, such as you got properly opening doors and no place to lift yourself up, you progress with overcoming this and earn the same - it's zen looking back, that if you were much less than you thought, you did not get where you headed, but you was still progressing and it's still rather rewarded by you and the others, by it's internal quality of capable movement; for example I learnt to survive in capitalism - but capitalism does not exist, it's no purpose to be just competitive; the experience of foolish people paying to ruin their own ethos, as they represented it - I do not want to fall back into evolution of price each time it's already known).

This gets us into the thesis: a little performance is a little performance; getting a little additional stretch is getting a little additional stretch. Disable people do not do *that*, but a balanced exercise to raise each of their abilities a millimeter and millisecond, is possible, and you would see this in whole life of them: a genius or a sportsman would see you just in their position, because you suddenly just say it's enough even moving to another thing.

Performance: a few times of falling less a day, little more of health recovery, each activity a little faster with a little bit better quality. If you say "a little" thousand times, Lenin's expectation would be exceeded - "a little" would now sound "quite enough". If you stay repeating it, it becomes ironic.

So, what I mean - it does not matter that they don't reach "there", because "there" would not exist. The first steps, the progress is important, but the destination, in this case, is not in vocabulary - it's already here, it's life itself. Even for disable people, if they would measure their current pleasure and pain - they can turn it into past. Without winning the olympics, which takes 2 millions in each case, for the really unstatistical distribution; we learn these people, but it they succeed in the 0.1% achievement, our hopes would move us from 50% to 49%, comparatively (in an average unit).

# Conclusion

For disabled people:
- They do have pains and pleasures, and we do signify them: thus, for each progress, they do have progress.
- The need of growth, development and exercise exists over all the gaussian curve.
- While specialized exercise for certain skill might be sometimes hard, for the consequence and effort, especially for the case that it might not earn back: studying your actual use of the muscle to understand the balance, and the actual development of each group especially weak, for the same purpose, will get you to exercise, which you can practice even in small amounts: you create a holistic health. For the same purpose, you might need some specialized exercise as well - this, indeed, creates a balance of higher force into the society itself (when we began to specialize, with enough body of different experiences and grand fields like theories, the society began to recognize more general growth balanced into aspects of life - this is the extrasociety like Christian or Confucian way, or the one of Marcus Aurelius yet balanced; each of us forms a whole on our own: as we generalize, we get a stable development of something we call _human_, and then why not _superhuman_ or a _percentage of human_; what we meet in Buddhism, Taoism, even Shamanism: a _human_ has variety of general skills, such as eating, sleeping or resting or relaxing, still going to shop except a few cases who create the shopping lists or obey or beg; each of our cells like plants and the planet and internal cityzens, such as the blood cells, they could follow the fractal or our development of smaller movements - differentiated enough, the small movements falls into influence of that group, such as influencing local molecular structures in first place and achieving more skill or substance afterwards, would lead to sub-zero dimension of our Zen: all these different structures inside us also have common things to develop, such as strength and flexibility or skill, and they have their specialization into tissues and other structures; for each pained, disabled area, we try to do our best - it's good to get pain levels lower or to get eventual pleasures so that our being pleased is more complete).
