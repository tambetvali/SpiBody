# The Taoist Canon - an index

The Internet Archive contains a list, with descriptions, of the Canon of Taoist, a complete collection of classical books - the length of this points that you really need to be immortal to read each of them, but herein I got a dream to mindfully read these three books to get vague impression about what to search from Google / ask from ChatGPT to get some actual reading.

These three books can be downloaded in various formats, including a zip file containing pdfs and called something like "daozang.zip". This could be the index of your interest in case you are into connecting body and mind.

I am a Buddhist and I want to describe as an instance, what I would do about this knowledge about the knowledge:
- Taoism, Buddhism and Confusianism is called by one source I instantly recognized a "harmonic three of China". You can find things like "Buddhist monk complaining over a Taoist master", but you will rather find the Buddhist monk speaking in terms of Tao and going deep into the Taoist wisdom, enrichening this with a few Buddhist remarks. This is different from the argument in Abrahamic family, and more similar to spiritual depths of the Abrahamic religions. You find each of them, writing in west, quoting Christ, for example - for example, some Buddhist book might mention that a Buddhist meditation could be replaced with a Christian prayer in the same instance, for the same goal. Tai Chi or Kung Fu, generally, are praised by Christian - but the philosophy, a central goal, is called to be "complex and for masters"; you won't find only ethics, but practical guidelines and deep thoughts in the actual philosophy, and you could even learn the Inner Kung Fu to serve yourself, in addition to the outer Kung Fu, which more often serves others. Philosophy, for beginners, such as silent sitting, could be practiced for five minutes per day - in a few months you can already calm down a little bit and find better uses for your Kung Fu than dumb battles. You could be insulted and called a jerk, but it's a common thing when you fly with the birds less than eagles; for an eagle in the Sky, you need eyes more than the beating muscle.
- Buddha's deep philosophy turns you into skeptical, open-minded person, who still seeks the perfection and thus could land on the improved tradition rather than "being different than others" - Russian tends to say "normal" about differences they accept in others, recognizing the deep normality even in things, which differ. If you build stable muscle, you seem like a gentleman - the one, who does not depend on muscle. If you grow into perfection, less can be said about your uniqueness related to those before you, barely do you hit them with a few seconds in advancement, which is noticeable. Once you learn your technique of special battle, you get a taste of each thing, which saves, cures and protects you, and with your creative continuation you just seem like others. Buddha is the master scientist, one who does not easily fall into speculation, but gives you a lot to speculate about - in the end, he has not said much as he invites you to bring your own experience and intuition to guide you in the first place; for example, the structure of heavens could hold even if it's only the difference between rich and poor of various things.
  - Taoist, here, does connect the Mind and Body into one religious activity. You body will be not only dangerous, but importantly it would be safe for you and the others, a vehicle upwards. How much you can be a good person, sharing bread and clothes, if you lack the capability to easily create those things, the physical light, yourself? Compare Taoist with Viking: an enlightened Viking, who brings the magical muscle to fight for the Heavens with you.
  - We will speak about Confucianism and Christianity once we reach the social level: once we got the healthy body, we want to structure the physical heaven (as Christ said, "to be brought to the Earth") and thus we give a little consideration to Confucian schools.
  - One cannot be so philosophical and deep about the physical structures to convince the one, who is not experienced, or to find expression, which would lead them to things they could be convinced in. In Buddhism, the Truth is rather trivial and one can find it in contemplations: in Taoism, you see the physical dance of stars and heavens, earth and your body, and in the _irrationality of physical things_ (see C.G.Jung) you cannot be so much convinced in the Truth: rather, you would trust the instincts of your body to be on the right track; notice that your body is way better than you in Physics and Chemistry - where you are creative, deep spirit, your body is a happy machine calculating exact numbers such as the blood pressure and an inertia of your moves; you can see more physical people who can move in the flow of forces like gravity, inertia and muscular pressures in way you could not calculate with your mind: here, you can see your body as the best doctor, physician, chemicist or even magician and alchemicist for you.
- You can see western science has proven many buddhist and taoist meditations, especially there are accounts about benefits of yoga or Tai Chi. Notice that _we do not easily account on this as the power is hidden within, and the external effects such as instant bliss are scientific only if the bliss leads to beneficial activities - practicing Taoism to get a good emotion, then keeping your common mind, would lead the good emotion in an atheist to be placebo, as the good emotion is not on it's own, but it is your feeling of being more able to help yourself and others and to flow naturally in nature or create artefacts of the city_.

How I am doing with Taoism as a Buddhist:
- Buddhist meditation is strong and proven force by which you can contribute into your health, mindset of the health or healthy activities; by which you can turn your mind into heavenly states and thoughts.
- If you practice merely mental activities: however true and good is the reason, however far the success could take you, it's like psychedelic drugs - once your trip is over and you do not sit quietly and concentrate your powers and wills, you fall apart into the same boring and mundane reality, wherein you see the routines as bad and killing you.
- You see Taoist as not so immediately True, where it's hard to easily find tautological proof for complex bodily movement - the expression of body is rather abstract (term defined by C.G.Jung) and it does not contribute to one singular Truth. Your senses are qualified, especially after meditations to feel it better and build the brain structures, to sense the feelings, vibrations and emotions inside the movement or to recognize the faces of people moving; most biological things are more or less what they seem and this is the basis of alchemistry or magic; we see beauty in healthy movement, we like the smell of the healthy body, and we enjoy the voice of a healthy person, rather than seeing bliss in lying in your own shit or something [notice I do not want to sound good in each sentence about each thing, so you can see some vulgar language use if I talk about each thing in war - too many beautiful words have been used in killing me].
  - While you won't see Truth in Taoism so trivially, you would see a healthy balance of Truth and Power.
- As a Buddhist I enjoy the case where the Taoist learns a central practice from Tibetan yoga, where the Hindu is telling me the Buddhist truth back from a fresh perspective, or where each of the three in harmony would find the basis of meditation of each being if not the same, then touching the same virtues, goals and methods so easily. Buddhist, generally, speaking about Tao, does not find a better word for this.

Each _religion_, definitely, is about uniting each of the religions, and that which could be seen as being outside the religion or belief; each case of a religion not learning from each other is it's fall in knowing, and each case a religion is not knowing each other is fall from being a religion, an unified, central theory. Each religion, still, has it's unique _capability_ and reason.

## Zen and Tao; Ching and Cross

"Zen and Tao" is a relative conception for religious feelings affected by Purity of Philosophy of Buddha, with Natural Solutions to Ecosystem; and by Bodily Growth including Martial Arts of Taoist Masters. Cossack blood is similar to Russian and Siberian in sense that it has the genesis for "Zen and Tao" - for they are not believers, they carefully learn the knowledge of their ancestors, but they sense in the progress a personal proof of each connection made out of their blood.

How to distinct Cossack or Central Eastern people from Russians and Siberians in sense of climate and political disposition of the (religio-)Shamanistic Belief, and by Taoist Canon you can compare the Chinese with their myriad epochs (such as Ming Dynasty) and regions (which used to be multiple, yet the people mix with Thailandia and other territories just as we see the Soviet Union cityzen - a Russian could be from another country, but they most remember us by the common life in Soviet Union, and they speak a language similar to Russian or mixed with Russian words, but sometimes this feeling is mixed with hate towards Russian - just as it's hard to distinct person of Polandia from a Russian by a common-person style, but the very same person might then attack a Russian by their words):
- Cossack: shares the religious feelings of Christians as much as needed to understand the word of the Christ, but has a genetic tendency for genesis of Zen and Tao, closely aligned with the rest of Central East - mostly very close to Chinese culture.
- Russian: adores Siberian Magician, is nearly Christian and associates strongly with "Sanskrit" (India); has the empirical (as in "empire") feelings with Cossacks and strong culture of Chinese culture, with many very similar developments in history of neighbourhood and near history of similarities between developments of Stalin and Mao, who followed each about 6 years later, as if in next cycle of 5 years; then Stalin could be more innovative and Mao more experienced in regards to developments in relation to Russian history we are interested about. While Christianity is regarded to metaphysics and the global Cosmos, russians share Shamanistic memories and familiar cooperations, such as making mystic fire in the forest, with Siberian and Central Eastern people, who each has born out of the Shamanism - Shaman would remember their history from being families in Africa, having differences but not developed into too deep in these, nor have they influence from their local territories and their possibilities.
- Siberian: in a land, where you can plant one tree for large area, of a snow desert, the tree must be magical, so your hands as your mind could be, have to be magical. Taoist conception is very similar, born out from the warmer climate and perhaps some associations with the deserts and different kinds of the land, either directly or indirectly with Sahara, the largest desert. Being that poor as Siberian of Sun and any other resource, sometimes it takes a miracle to only plant a tree, even if it's an oasis for a larger group of people by any advantage in the land use, but let's imagine the roots of a tree must reach far as the cold land is always slower, and we need more solar batteries to energize a water system. Each process, including work in the light to charge the batteries of a plant to produce it's fruits: a rich fruit might come from years of growth of a plant, so it must be a multi-year plant? A Siberian would come to Russia and plant a plant or a tree - and the plant or a tree would become a history. Each of us humans, united by magic, would like to eat some vitamin-rich fruits to do the magic on our bodies; a Shaman is a person to plant this - later, the religious feelings for the forests and the plants, as well as physical surroundings; when they are religions for small areas, where the small gods could be just spirits, we adore our local neighbourhood and remember when the humans were a small group, did they start any rhythym to have instruments in the world regions for each. Cossack and Viking are the same degree North, and the Nature asked them both to survive with a few resources, where the magic of Plants and Forest would decide your life, but from this small religion: you can grow these feelings to understand the bigger ecosystem, and put some flesh into your belief of God: from some Vision, God is nothing but an Union, a Cooperation. Thus, Siberians as Vikings share the Christian Belief and Communist History for men coming together.

Islam as well is East, and they share a piece of history with Sanskrit cultures, which belonged to their Brotherhood and Empire back then. Each empire we know will leave it's fruits, so for example we have Pakistan with Islam, accounting for the same principle in their histories. We can see Indian belief, perhaps more local than it seems, in the Islam Sufis, "spiritual islam" or even our all-respected "magicians of the Egipt", which was open enough to share the science with it's territories; presence of Islam in Africa was as well led from the East, leaving a trace in the culture, such as spread of the word of Muhammad, one of the three Abrahamic religions - looking all these people, "Abraham" could also be seen as metaphor of the white man, where Russians, as white, principially remember the Abraham family - for where the humankind started, where in the nearby family could Chinese and American natives start their change; and what is the imapct between Russian and Chinese blood? So it's culturally tied, the Islam and the Sanskrit religions, sciences and philosophies. Jews, as well, are around the Eastern areas; we can imagine a friendly history between Cossacks, Jews and Muslims, Muslims being the native Islam cityzens, from a culture of Islamic Emperor, a name close to "Arab" - back then, they would have lived peacefully in the territories around the sea. Thousand and one night, from many books in Arabic to perhaps two books in our most common Western translations we could access easily. These two books are the most readable source to learn about Islam in context of being culturally open and multicultural religion with rather beneficial ties, such as respect between the mystic scientist of this time, between the cultures; we can see neutrality of race and religion and multitude of different ways of thinking and religions - this is a fairy tale version of the Islam, as compared to the current situation, which seems to be off-balance.

Now, China is one of the Eastern cultures, as opposed to Europe and America being the West and having the histories of the Wild West, initiated from Roma and Egipt, in regards to modern language and mathematics or symbolism. As Kybalion states, Egiptian and islamistic people have hold an European secret about the magic, known as Hermecism - by greek god Hermes, in one association.

How much it takes for a myth to reach from any of these countries to another, given that even Vikings and "Eskimos", now Innuites, would have connected American and the rest of Northern culture, or it would be relatively easy to reach America from some port of Siberia - even by accidential losses of direction, where one has to land somewhere nearby, we can compare probabilities of reaching with kayacks and canoes, with the actual history of that reach (Erich the Red, a Viking); not many men are necessarily so unique or so surprised to find another ice berg, and two men could meet if they start a few-day trip from both directions, to measure the open see: just seeing a man of the different race, even onboarding a person from the group for love between man and woman: this could explain the Native Americans of North from pictures I have seen, who resemble the Seaman from my Island of Vikings, Saaremaa (my mothers genetics) - it would be miraculous chance to not having some common genes from later than who-knows-when, either Erich the Red or any other person. Could they know genetic trace of their families, or any real stories passing some centuries, but definitely in the age of written word and ancient sanctuaries? And who could completely have integrated the central properties of this low-influence gene, so that they could express the trait of Eurasian man of how it actually works in the American context? Could they have fought for part of European culture in regards to integration to their own genes, and familiar needs and opportunities? Could they remember the Christ, Odin, Freya or even a long walk from Asia to tell a message in genes or letters? In this case, how much it took for a sentence to spread around a word; and how much it could have taken for theories such as 4 or 5 elements, which differ more between India and China than India and platonic or classical Europe - Platon, if we trace, associated the least noticeable element, ether or higher air, only to serve as a Mind, unifying intelligence, or either the Chrown of the Whole-Consciousness or the Throat of Communication; we are left with 4 elements once we remove those traces of Life, Universe and Communication; yet, to explain the "element" not only in terms of what we have composed it of, or by what it has composed, but also in terms of element of itself, such as we can live in elements of Rock'n'roll or a city, or rather to "be in our own element", which would prove disappointment if the "element" of the unification, Ether or the Space, would not be physically present as the story of the interconnectedness of the element - the distance between us is a requirement; as in the advanced realm, for each living creature, which occupies an unit of space and mass of the matter which is the yang, both distance and plastic, intentionally or unintentionally "dead" matter must exist: for if all the matter and space would want to be alive, and to form a creature, the creatures would lack any distance and become dependent of each others in any movement or change in the environment. So lack of the Space element could be a nightmare: while the neck and head chakras form the central palace for our elements, they can also be imagined as the parallel chakra for Etheric element: lower chakras, less visionary and more related to mundane world, holding the simplistic but very responsive, aware and instinctual behavior of the brain related to our back bones - both internal organs and external movements, such as central control of hands and legs and not their abstraction or "driver", a projector and receiver from the head brain, which has the vision in the upper parts, forming three frequencies - unified axe in meridians starting from top of the head, the centers and variable structure of the visionary chakras in upper half of the head, more metaphysical backwards and upwards, connecting to the "absolute reality", which could be holistic vision from our senses or even science and metaphysics, including mathematical abstraction and it's imagination or present imaginagion of habitual flow; front and downwards, even to the neck, this presentation connects to exterior world, where we have non-local senses and facial muscles, throat and mouth for non-local expression of emotion and truth. While the body connects only physically, and the legs connect to the matter such as the ground; body and "magically" from distance, hands, each connect the four elements of our bodies: body would provide the full connection, while hands provide the connection with bodies on the distance, but the hands are very intelligent and aware themselves, especially if trained in a proper practice, such as intelligent work with materials instead of routine practice, and spiritful exercise instead of repetition of 3-axe geometries. Our body has it's own distances and forces in relation to it's own flexibility, speed and force, and ones of their relatives and collaborators; even technology and help in transportation would enchange the larger distances rather reflected (forth and back) in our brain and it's powers, such as power of will, power of throught, and karmic power of mindfulness present mentally in Buddhist monk, mentally and materially in Taoist practicioner, or in regards to gentle attention we can see a physical form of meditation in a gentleman, intellectually in civilized person, or the extreme awareness, thus attention, of a primitive human, to any traces in the nature.

The attention:
- Primitive man and their shamans readily develop the sharpest senses to the nature and any trace in it, in their neighbourhoods, which is visible like a muscle, keeping a very typical posture we can meet in each part of the world. It's a common asset of humankind. They follow local spirits, gods of the neighbourhood.
- The raising man with their priests and magicians have sharp interest of techniques and technologies they can develop, including social ones. They are represented by multitude of gods relating to their non-unified attentions to each science, without a common principle.
- The civilized man with their gentlemen achieve attention to women, to people and their ideas, as well as complex mental constructs and huge projects, which could spread to galaxies already in their stories. They build religions and churces, so there are gentlemen and monks: the power and the church are separated. Hindu religion originated in this period in India, where there is one trinity of one god.
- The post-religious realm of Buddhism and materialism, as well as modern, open-minded versions of each religion and shamanistic, alchemical or magical practice occur as: each civilization is born, and it will merge the knowledge of each known civilization and form a complete human life, still having seemingly very different beliefs. As we solve the logic equations, even the metaphysical aspect of each world seems so different, yet they all bring us to food, clothes and buildings, and form the same ideas about cooperation, unified theories or sciences and religions, and paradoxes between one God, multitude of gods and no God at all - moreover, in certain times they support different versions in all these possibilities. We enjoy different meals, each being food for all the humans, we enjoy the music from different principle; we understand that while each reached one God or unified science, the gods at their face value would form a multitude or even fight - based on your surroundings, generalized to infinity, the one Good seems so different, of your own race or in future problem your own biological and material composition shared by any illuminated race; just when you try to make some material structures illegal: another form of life, possibly, made the intelligent and creative developments of the physical equilibrums and the mental counterparts, which also reaches metaphysics, science or religion: mentality is necessary in each possible world and the metatheory would unite even alternate possibilities of reality; if quantum superpositions would show their alternate solutions, and there could be many magical relations to alternate realities, such as necessity to solve another possibility to resolve into this one, as a negative solution - if quantum superpositions are formed out of combinatoric problems they resolve in life and quantum computers, forming some kind of oracles or logic oracles, some kind of theories, which cannot clearly define what separates certain activity of matter, as a neutral cause-effect relation with no regards to it's philosophical explanation of subject, then it could be goal or an objective, such as light particles moving based on their future situation, out of oracles or absolute symmetries in the laws of the nature to very complex processes; if, in reality, both are possible, and if, in this case the cause of such process is related, in it's present form, to actual tension towards solving such possibilities: this could be seen as the future situation having very clear and even far, perhaps from Sun to Earth, intelligence or preeffect of the future cause; in one word it has Vision: each of these, as relating different bodies over their current reaction, is the Etheric or Space element in the Nature, where it's not intelligent enough to have 3 chakras.

Natural elements are not so closely related to our mental chakras to form only one system - we can see a fractal of different systems, theories and religions reflecting one higher metaconception; we see our body, which has different parts processing local and global information and force, and by causal connections or it's own nature, even to radioactive reactions or non-local, instant communication such as ESP and ESJ (extra-sensory judging, where jungian system would separate P and J to such letters in it's four-letter interpretation of personality types, and Jung is close to Tao and the magic); we see thermodynamic laws, giving and receiving of energy, appearing in each system. Does our life change at the moment, when we do the work, or the moment, when we decide to do it - when the energy is invested and when it's just a process of cause and effect? How much we can even oppose the logic and the vision, and what makes the vision "instant" - are our eyes tracing our own world in real time, or should they trace a bullet or non-local space to say it's instant and effective? I would say our minds, really, use the available means to solve the same problem, either through evolving repetition or through generalizing it, either through direct visions of time and space or intellectual and experience-based estimations, and numerous forces each want solutions to these things, even intelligence and cognition and creativity - in each realm of existence, there could be heavy causes to form cognition and creativity, and we could reach into relevant philosophy and verify many aspects once we could measure their benefits; in each case, existing structures become intelligent - humans have many layers and centers, which would be important members in constitution of this intelligence and accelerating factor in these aspects, the deccelerating factor for negative counterpart once it has the resolution or worse but not worst, some alarming and teaching experience. We can see our minds form centers, which govern aspects of internal and external structures - our minds are able to generalize, simplify and systematize and provide us with visions, which are used for communication with these; intellectual layer allows to mentally create and control these, while the more intuitive layers might create more sense-like structures; where the body is aware of each single muscle, many forces and principles, and their applications: "hand movement" as perceived by our minds is not less an imagination than our auric senses, once they reflect a model of reality, because the nerves and muscles and small reactions would reflect the reality much less symbolically.

Herein, let's enter the realm of Tao - one, which starts from philosophy of Lao Tze, probably influencing almost each reader from youth, and flows through the spiritual, religious, atheist; more mind-oriented or more materialistic versions of Tai Chi or Qi Gong, and into many expressions such as Kung Fu; where it also relates to other eastern, and recognizes western traditions in many aspects; then, through Taoist Canon, it enters into complex understanding of Mind and Body, a practice rather than initiation - most people, I guess, would either not understand or feel an initiation when reading Daodejing of Lao Tze. We can see a lot of cross-influences, but we could really want to unite all these physical and mental occurrences into one single tradition.

Ching and Cross: I would say once we want to build a society, Christian teachings form the abstract imaginary of a civilization, and our Western civilization continues it's scenario of survivial; they are to society like Buddhism is to the Individuality: Christ could create a simple unified vision of benefits of cooperation. Confucianism, like Taoism, believes in cooperation on very material basis - it would train the unification of people, just teaching them to be an official, a man who thinks in terms of horses, cars, food, family and each value creating a civilization. People like Marcus Aurelius provide to these dreams, who is like enlightened to this nature.

So, we are creating introspiritual and extraspiritual maps of the practice, individual and collective forms of it in mental and material realms, and this unites several different religions. We could join Taoist to build ourselves, and pray in the Heavenly temple of Confucionism to join into higher, metaphysical clubs, or create an invaluable philosophy of growth through support from the most theoretical words of the Christ, ideally in a non-political organization of the Church.

## Three books to imagine the Taoist Canon

Format: it's sometimes hard to select and copy pages, inconsistently.

Fransiscus Verellen, Kristofer Schipper (editors) are the editors of the books to introduce you with the names in the Taoist canon.

#### The Taoist Canon - Volume 1

##### Antiquity through the Middle Ages

This introduces _Daozang_, or Taoist canon, as a "vast collection of texts in a wide variety of genres that comprehensively define Taoism and its scriptural development through the ages.

It is called a "Ming canon" and groups masters, authors and books from this period of time. As not all of the work can be related to main themes of three books, it also contains some related materials.

#### The Taoist canon - Volume 2

##### The Modern Period

It introduces that the era starting with the advent of the Song dynasty in the second half of the tenth century may be considered the beginning of the modern age in the history of China.

It's the development period of the civilization and Taoism.

#### The Taoist canon - Volume 3

##### Biographies, Bibliography, Indexes

Here are the names, articles in various languages, and a dictionary of Taoist concepts, mostly referring in numbers and lists of numbers - preprocessing with database system or artificial intelligence with access to internet searches, perhaps, could let you generalize the information into an interesting aspect, generate an actual dictionary related to something or list interesting resources for Taoism - or rather you could use existing Taoist search engines and see what can be done with licences.

In each case the collection is quite big - it might be meaningful to read first two volumes, and it might be meaningful to use an AI system to study compressed versions first. I think this especially because it's full of chinese hieroglyphs and expressions - you must consider about how to link to this information.
