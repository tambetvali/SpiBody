# Train Nerves, Meridians and Equilibrium

This is three levels of high-frequency rougly in the following order:
- Nerves, as a tissue, are cell brains and thus relate to fractal of heads (head is the head topology of this fractal).
- Meridians are the coordinate systems in which you operate. While I use general, philosophical term, the Meridians of Taoism and Acupuncture refer to linear functions through a set of complexes / syndromes [a.la. "The Kundalini Syndrome" in publicized enlightenment-related materials of C.I.A., a word which might initially insult you: it means complex of function, which can be problem complex in it's initial phase or dissonant development]; Taoist Meridians end in a Crown chakra, in one point: Chrown, generally, is about your position or interposition in extern environment, and divides into symmetric areas in your vision - it relates to how you move in an imaginary realm. This is very intuitive to connect meridians as coordinate system to meridians of Taoism.
- Equilibrum: this is your sense of balance and execution of it.

## Head of a hologram

Hologram is a complex fractal of repeated imagery. In your brain, at altitudes or frequencies near your eyes of third eye, you have generalized processing. Each hologram, in this processor, will gather all the repeated information into one dynamic, moving and imaginary picture of "higher vision": I call it a topology, fractal head or it's symbol for a hologram:
- For all the repeated pieces, they are generalized into repetition of a pattern.
- This pattern is generalized into single image: it's a singularity or topology of the repeated form: for example, pattern which has circles positioned in circular form, has fractal head of one circle. Notice that it's very hard to connect opposites here.

### Head brain

This is your non-local, "eternal" vision - eternally, you want to find a single theory or practice, which would help you through all varying experiences, but remain the same itself. Science, high vision and any physical or virtual higher-sensory perception is here; notice that sense organs in head are non-local - while you won't see the whole Universe with your eyes, you can see a lot from the mountaintop, having a physical vision, and smell or sound also spread in time and space like waves in the ocean; chaotic waves become resonant structure of similar topology and you say in prular, that there are small waves, large waves or some pattern of waves - "small wave" is a fractal head of fractal of small waves you actually find, but it could be also a chaotic fractal head of original, different wave impulses which synchronized into this pattern. That water does not make a contract is highly unusual.

To understand this, imagine the functions of areas around chakras, described vaguely:
- Crown has a single, unitary image of the whole reality, especially or centrally yours: confront the paradox, why it's "your crown". Rough solution to the paradox: hologram has high quality if it is large, projection of brains of many people; if it's small, projection of one person, it has less quality - each person adds qualities to crown chakra functioning, which is equivalent to mathematical frequency of infinity.
- Vision has a head topology, head of the fractal, where you conceptualize complex systems into essentials, such as theories into their central axioms or cities into their common function.
- Communication is where you see yourself as a part of these topologies and wholities.

Axes of Focus, here, occur in external world, such as surrounding space and sub-biological particles, waves or matter (internal and external aspects of being extern to the mind and biological life body).

This is the higher-frequency motosensory system, therefore intellectual.

### Back brain in spine

This is the lower-frequency motosensory system, therefore physical. It's located in the brain of your spine, and it's closest systems or related organs.

- Heart is the non-topological view of the whole, which has a non-repeating, creative understanding and intent for the uniqueness of each person managed as a collective whole.
- Solar Plexus is the complex or syndrome of the body and self: where minus and plus infinity meets, division of parts from repetition of the wholes, Solar Plexus is the center. When running, your legs might connect only up to stomach, creating pain on left and right side of this syndrome until you train holistically and ensure all the connections of your whole body work well. This is related to connecting left and right of your brain and body (creative and analytic), top and bottom of your body (collective and subindividual), front and back (future or action with past or experience; back is at the same time the past and the ultimate future, it's where the idea realm is). "Plexus" means it connects muscles from all the opposites, and "solar" means it radiates evenly to each side of the opposition. While bottom of your body with top of your legs is one important solar plexus of the more distant view seen when you stand normally, the central complex of your body also unites all the forces so that they interact properly. Sub-individual and collective, in the middle, have unity of one person related to unities of each other.
- Emotion chakra: infinity bends the directions, assigning deep, vibrating meaning; here, you relate particular things to this united feelings; Chrown chakra with it's total vision (relate to third eye as the global vision or communication as the local vision) - it projects local "particles" here, where each single thing is in relation to how it interacts with the totality of the whole.
- Material and Biological chakra: on the bottom, each particular thing relates to itself, being one part of complex whole. Rather than meanings, you have very local conceptions here: for example, while the Crown might be busy finding your unique, personal wife and it's very hurt where the wife would betray this illusion - Root chakra would just take care that somebody is cooking, you grow the children up etc., and it does not know the unique personality of your wife - rather, it knows whether you have strong wife, beautiful wife or intelligent wife, and in it's planning it does not see much difference between one and another intelligent wife. It does not care about specific cook, kitchen or party / picnic - those are not the unique things; it's unique thing is the meal itself, with how it works on you, or how the particular music works, but it's not able to put the music, food, and people together into specific party or event - or if it does, it's just this particular party or event at this particular place in this particular time, an unique experience, and does not gather much meaning in collective of experiences.
 - While emotional chakra relates personally to loss of friend, but not so much about this particular friend, root chakra might just think: this friend provided me with cotton and fur, so where I find cotton and fur?
 - Root chakra is the lowest frequency.

Relate these freqencies as four corners of your body:
- Head, especially the crown: Plus infinity, which is _always_ a plus infinity. It's your ultimate environment.
- Palms, and fingers: Plus finity, or the biggest number before infinity: This finds new horizons as you grow, it's not an absolute ideal infinity but the one of your life.
- Feet, and toes: Minus finity, it's your changing position.
- Hips, ass, genitals, especially the root: Minus infinity, which is _always_ a minus infinity. It's your ultimate home, the deepest idea of where you came from - your legs might be walking and walking on the road, taking each step and progressing, while your hips only show the style of your walk, and once you gave a birth you don't need to do it again.

Over the head there is the stairway to heaven and you might put your hands up - then it's either the hands, or it's even above them. Here, the external world is unfolding: while this comes from outside, it's symbol of the coming itself; as the coming things reach you, it will reach your crown, coming back in time, and become your own understanding.

Under the feet or in different sense, under your body if you sit down on the ground, with root grounded: your dead ancestors, history, origin of the universe still has unresolved karma and you are the result of your past intent, as well as it's the result of the past experience: roots contain the unprocessed information.

Idealistically, root symbolizes the smallest primitives of your thought, like point fields, while the crown symbolizes the final idea you have digested and perfected - it's like a view of the cloud, solid space of those points, not their repetition.

## Axes of Focus and **Body as a Mind**

You can envision your body as a mental syndrome to connect it with your experience. This is mapping of high frequencies into space of low frequencies.

I generalize "nerves" and "synapses" of body into mind, and assign mental terms to "sensors" and "motors". Here you find the equilibrum of axes: balance, which should orient you in developing yourself.

- Internal nerves: brain tissue and central nerve system for introspection
  - Here, your nerves process abstract information, inside between sensory and motor nerves.
  - Synapses of those nerves are the actual synapses of your brains.
  - This is your self, whole, mind or mentality; it's the crown.
- Sensory nerves
  - These sensor systems are cells or organs, which form your interest, senses, your understanding.
  - Synapses, here, are also actual synapses connecting this as a nerve system.
  - This is your head in general - vision and communication, and vaguely the crown.
  - Nerves are the physical sensation of your body; removing a nerve - you remove a sensation; developing a nerve - you develop a sensation.
- Motor nerves
  - These are the muscles, the parts of force, which form a willpower of your body.
  - "Synapses" of these are the connections, which make your body into a single system, where you can be exact with your hands with only feet on the ground - if you are broken in solar plexus and centers of each fractal axe, these are not connected and you have to find close support for your muscle, such as keeping hands on table when working.
  - This is your body in general: heart, solar plexus and emotion, and vaguely the root.
- External nerves: imaginary tissues you can sense outside your body
  - This is the virtual nerve, which describes an external world in terms of it's being vision in your body; you feel moving external things with your mind when it intelligently reads your intent and responds; such simulation can be seen and developed in dance and singing.
  - Project this above your head: as you place hands above your head, such as at the concert, your body understands it this way; or it's also above your whole body.
  - You see the "opposite" is not the root - as we talk about nerves and meridians, both opposites relate to high and very high frequency.

## Acceleration and Velocity

Physically:
- Intelligence is the velocity, the low-frequency supersystem: here, you use your muscles and they respond according to experience; it's the use of your existing powers without pushing it much.
  - Intelligence is seemingly the active force, it needs energy from moment to moment from whole your being, with habits and skills being the higher frequency of this. It's also a passive force, which rather slows down than speeds up without additional effort. It's practiced in states of action.
- Creativity is the acceleration, the high-frequency supersystem: here, you train and develop your muscles; body creativity is first to train the muscles, second if they start to neglect the potentials and futures and generalize the training - over time, you get tired in deep and complex way, and your mind and body responds by intelligent growth. "Creativity" is term about your growth, which cannot be directly seen as genetic makeup or a direct response to getting tired; you have complex fatique here.
  - Creativity is seemingly the passive force, where you do not need effort for it to go on - initially, you train, then your pain deepens and you start to consider the future and your training speeds up. In imaginations or when you watch pictures, like the ones of yogis, might trigger your muscles to learn - you feel how they acknowledge the energy. Their solar plexus or "self" is when they start to guide you through the exercise.

## Body's need to train

Your body shows certain parts as idiots: it easily insults the part of itself you *need to train next*, creating an element of shame, which allows your material growth just as the physical pain, if not fatal, is the trigger of a direct growth response.

Once you have trained these parts, you enable the process further - the body will find new parts of itself, and show them as idiots instead, becoming happy or more conscious about the parts you trained.

Eventually, pain is repeated with positive motive: trained part of body creates hormones of pleasure as you move it, and you enjoy the activity.

There is sharp line between minus and plus: about your body, health etc., you are sharply either concerned or happy! It's not to compare people: it's your main target to get above zero, where you are not approaching death, but the natural length of your life. Call this a **point of enlightenment**.

## Equilibrium

Equilibrum in general is when system is heading up, progressing further, and remaining is stable condition of enabled activity.

It consists of:
- External axes: senses of equilibrium disposition you in relation to the external world, such as the ground and nearby objects, or the basic forces such as gravity and acceleration.
- Internal axes: equilibrium in each part of your body are about their proper relation, connection and interaction with other parts.

It's sensorymotoric process: you sense your disposition, and only to keep it still you need movement towards a stable way of this position. For example, you concentrate on standing still, or to make it more obvious on standing on one leg - this system is constantly reactive to neglect each potential of falling to ground, so it's very active just to stay the same.

You equilibrium: you are very active just to remain yourself. Once you fall down, it's more complicated and rather theoretical, inner property.

Train your nerves: I give some exercise of this. To properly train your nerves, the first step is to understand their training:
- You have several means to get your nerves tired. In fact, any movement does this little by little, where your sensation becomes less solid and starts to lag; for example read a book faster and faster.
- In certain sequences, you can do this: weaker parts of your body lose their senses, such as external side of your little finger and connected palm area. For example, when you repeatedly touch your own skin and each time move your finger 1-2cm when keeping slight pressure, eventually your finger stops sensing.
- Repetition of this exercise creates analogous feelings to muscle growth, also the case of being "seriously tired", which means that this non-sensation makes pain rather than just a little discomfort.
- You can see nerve complexes growing, when you watch your skin: it could be red and create a little hole-like area, in opposite to muscles, which create hills.

Fractally, this all relates to your head: nerve itself is a local head. This means, nerves in your lower body, legs and feet are initially less able to be aware; walking and running are basically monotone, repeated activity charged by weak subsystem senses. Taoist book of Mantak Chia compares that death starts from the legs - so, if the legs are resistent to aging processes, your life might become longer. Overall, it's a very pleased and energetic experience to have your *whole body*.

While elements of your organism have the focus in head and the palms of your hands, the space of your organism has some preferred areas: head is upright and straight from the body, as you stand or lie, and hands are in front of your head - this is the initial focus or attention, the creative force you have without effort.

The Zen, a holistic and non-centralized experience, means that you balance and distribute your attention to each position around your body.

**Consciousness**: Attention of Body is all the positions you can take without losing your motors and senses, which is awake if wide range of positions are covered; *Awareness* is all the positions you can take without losing the focus and *Attention* is the activity of such sharp movement: when you work with a thing in front of you, with your hands, you can say your attention is in front of you, on this specific task. Higher-frequency attention is to train this part.

Hands, in low positions behind your back are actually exploring the unconsiousness - subconscious body of yours is behind your back, where you lack the awareness - awareness is an ability to act there, intelligently. Let's call this a subconsciousness of your space elemental body - legs are the subconsciousness of your element body.

Put your hands into subconscious positions - "sub" means you are going to develop this, for example, because for example after a few meters starts rather the "un"-conscious area of your low-frequency physics, such as feelings of touch and body muscle activities, which do not cover this distance in a way as smell, hearing and vision do:
- Hands are in lower back.
- Now, imagine movements, which are simple to do in front of you.
- You now run dissonant to your equilibrium: you vaguely understand relative positions of fingers, you don't understand exactly the directions of movements and you might lack sensory input.
- Notice that as you are unconscious, you are unconscious - even the mirror does not help you much. In other people, your consciousness is similar - you cannot see their moves very well without developing consciousness; this is the hologram fractal effect - you train your own consciousness behind your back, but movements of others behind their backs also become sensible for you, from a cryptic fluidum of rational, practical pieces, such as "finger moving", but not understanding where or why.

Your mission if you want to keep the balance and coordination:
- Repeat the exercises. As you do an exercise, your muscle grows - consequently, you are even less aware of what you have, because more complex movement potential means you cannot be aware. You get them tired and lose awareness as a result.
- As you focus and pay attention - this means, continue with exercises -, your muscle grows first; at certain point of development, your nerves start to pain and the relations and positions start to become clear and make sense - this means you are becoming aware of these areas, for example if you plan your activities, you will be aware of such possibilities and not the lack of them; this means you are more intelligent person. Notice that people, when they interact with more intelligence, resonate that it's more intelligent - for example, while cleaning your room takes more muscles to be effortless, doing it effortlessly and clearly appears as intelligence; an idiot might only lack motori and sensory abilities and unlike lacking any intent, will or desire.
- Your destination: in balanced system of motosensory (physical; nerves and muscles) unity with planovisionary (mental; brain nerves and simulation nerves, which provide your introspection and extroversion), which you associate with other exercises of nerves, you achieve the following:
- Your nerve activities are extending and developing.
- You dig deeper into nature of this, and build a fractal, where you see head of the cell, head of a human, head of the society.. In fractal of theories, where you relate different body parts as multiparadigm theories: unified theory is the stem cell, as well as your undifferentiated instinct, where it divides into different types of cells and individuated instincts - approaching creativity as it learns to respond to environment. These theories are physical: as you learn to train your nerves from multiple aspects, such as having awareness behind you and consciousness you train also some essential elements of this theory - this theoretic energy in your body spreads and the essential activate this desire in your body and mind. Desire creates something muscular - in your body, a vibrating energy starts to develop a wholistic energy system, where at this point you have some muscles; in your mind, you understand the feelings, prerequisites and consequences of such training, and start to develop both proper exercise, perhaps a diet, and also specific willpowers to directly train these parts.

## Fractal elements of meditation

Meditation, if seen as an abstract activity of brain, does influence each prerequisite of your health: it creates proper habits and intents. Holistically, you feel life force and the large-scale patterns of constitution of your health become visible, so that your pressure becomes to energize your health. For example, you eat better and more carefully, you have less conflict with less troubles you create, and you feel the health, in general, is more understandable and more under your control.
- You can feel it as a high-frequency health vibration.

Meditation has fractal theoretic elements:
- As you concentrate on emotions and pure intentions, the pure means it's essential and more general to both your whole system and parts of it, as well as it's essence as a part of the environment or the whole.
- Emotions, which vibrate in your cells, are very similar to ones, which vibrate in your central systems of cognition and brain.
- Pure intent can mean more essential goals, such as health and well-being, which contain paradigms for cells and the body.

Here, the meditative approach is not only about **conscious awareness** in your brain and vaguely in your nervous system, but it's much more: the same energy vibrates between people, and it illuminates and transcends your cells. Relaxing to take time for well-being and health: in group meditation, vision affected by personal meditation, and the way organs and cells relate and vibrate with such meditation and health, means it progresses and develops in the fractal - not because you would control each cell by your will, which for our purpose can be seen more close to impossible, but because they have *similar frequencies* and *essentials of life*.

For example, if your intent is aggressive, your body might start to vibrate aggressively and learn that habit; if your intent is balanced or towards love and nutrion, the systems of your body and environment also learn different frequencies of such intent, which appears very similar when scaled.

This means: not you, but the "underconscious" parts of you, will use this energy of intent for it's good.

To amplify this on cellular level:
- Individuate the muscles: as you train further, with steady progress rather than singular hard efforts, it will individualize and singular muscular intents break into thousands and millions parts of intents.
- Learn physical activities such as vibrations to empower your spine brain, touch to make your skin respond by it's tiny particles, let the water fall on you to get further with how your skin responds to the water, and so on.

Learn that while I do not do acupuncture (I activate force points through exercise to get sharp pain): those points respond on level of the fractal, get irritated, excited and need to use a little healing energy; the whole experience and force gathered would develop the whole fractal. Taoist science of acupuncture is very general science and you can find many ways about relating and using the acupuncture - my basic way is to give special meanings to growth of my body, which creates sharp pains in mostly other areas than the ones being trained, and I give this meaning to exercises and patterns, which do that.
- One method is to train one part of your body, where hands are more simple and legs more efficient (I chose hands), with so long and slow cycles that the training effects spread. Use your intuition to dive deeper into these experiences. This is for more irrational people.
- For more rational people and less sensory intuitive, the methods could be study of Taoist books and special exercises; targeting your exercise in such way means you have dangers of intense local training - training intuitively, you hit all those dangerous areas by random chance, but this is more balanced like Zen and has less dangers of the rational process; it does not create specific intensity on any singular point unless you really enjoy it. Self-control is good, but you might become too yang. This means: in this study, actual material means and throughout coaching might help you.

Notice: when watching pictures of Mantak Chia, my body responded directly to energies of his postures and utilized the synchronicity by which I did watch them at correct time - in this intuitive, natural process the danger level is very low; it activated some energies in my whole body, on essential level, to develop further intuition and progress.
 - For doing exercises of Mantak Chia: notice his general and specific warnings and understand that those exercises can be of very high intensity and effect, and following a program means you have to follow this exactly. As he says, this "traditional" viewpoint must be executed in such a way: balance your mind and cure mental problems, go to his lineage of school and study the particular dangers about each exercise. If you do not understand this, consider the acupuncture book: there are instructions for needling, but exact locations of veins, arthers, energies, even the specific distances and your personal aspects of the body: it's really fearful to needle yourself based on this book.

## Fractal of frequencies

Consider 3 base frequencies:
- Lowest frequency: your cells.
- Middle frequency: your self.
- Higher frequency: your society.

How to measure this frequency?
- Plane of each appears as repeated patterns, and the space of each plane is equal in most meaningful measurement.
- "Window" of Fourier Transform is smaller for cells, bigger for people, and even bigger for societies. As bigger the window, as higher the frequency.

Notice that for higher frequency, the vibration pattern is shorter. Directly, in Fourier Transform, a faster frequency appears in smaller window and I seem to see it inversed. Here you need deeper math.

Consider this:
- Frequency consists of impulse of energy, and for each realm you define the energy: it's a creative thought, impulse of health, a meaningful pulse of your system. For example in realm of money, material frequency is how frequently you move dollars, cents or euros.
- Local frequency of money occurs each time people give and receive money - an impulse of this strength is passed and forms a wave of the frequency, or it's particle (in wave-particle identity paradigm).
- This is *not* a metaphor, if you dive into essence of a frequency, which is a frequency of energy; using my math, an infinity creates *meaning*, which removes paradox from frequency of life force: energy is not plain movement, but considering incompleteness of systems and their evolution and development, energy is movement and standing still, which also resists the test of time or other infinities, such as the whole chain of logical thought. In higher math, thus, this being a frequency of energy is very direct.
- Higher systems are more structured and the synergy and synchronicity, in general effects with straightforward "syn-" prefix in their names, are *accelerated*. This means, the infinity is projected to zero, and coming down from infinity means coming down from zero: in math to be purposeful, energies at infinity must be measureable at zero, and they create a meaningful cycle.
- Projection of accelerated effects into sub-zero frequencies creates a very complex, *harmonic pattern*: there is an octave relation, which means these high social events resonate with resonance under our material substance, and their accelerated nature means this projection has high speed.
- All these effects together mean: while brain seems to process slowly, and the cells are very fast, the experience of mental vibrations in brain are very high, fast and intence, where our spine brain and legs rather connect to basses. We hear high pitch with our ears and low pitch with our body.
- In accordance to "high" and "low", which also mean global or large-scale and local or small-scale, our senses and the words we attribute, mean that "higher" and "lower" map several times, in uniform shape, to create metadimension, which creates a parallel space dimension for vibration, scale, body structure and our vision itself. You can look it in opposite way: basses mean often something destructive, a destruction of our civilization, and it creates some aggressive feelings if you do not understand the bass of others; high pitches, on the other hand, remind of "beautifully singing" and we associate them with happiness, union and cooperation - so we distinct low frequencies into low culture and high frequencies into high culture. As I said, meaning of art, our inner symbolic language and any kind of visions and "extrasensory perceptions" typically use *common space of meaningful form*, it's highly unusual to see that your high-frequency channels of vision would differ much from associations and perceptions of form, which have not synthesized into larger complexes of vision, hearing or other senses.

What I mean by such perceptions forming an "other channel": when a sensitive can draw humans with auras, they can naturally draw humans without auras. Auras, thus, are processed by separate layers and systems, and they do not interfere with main image. "Hallucination", indeed, is if undifferentiated functions create too close analogies to these - typically this is not normal to think an aura might hit you, while it might disturb your energy body and create wounds, as well, on specific layers of imagination or reality. The difference between imagination and reality, where the imagination is based on realistic model, is very small - in mathematics, it's not a big difference whether you can project a consistent dimension, which is consistent with actual models, or whether this dimension "really exists" in sense that it's directly on coordinates of your basic paradigm.
