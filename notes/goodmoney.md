# On good money and miracles

Some people say that natural cures, moral help and other services must be provided for nothing; they are biased.

Miracle:
* In every mathematical system, long-term effects influence the short-term effects; large-scale effects influence the small-scale effects.
* Miracle is an event, where in a mathematical, thermodynamic system, the long-term gain gains such an evidence that the short-term event seems to break the laws.

Bad alchemy, witchcraft:
* This is an even where it's thought it would happen for no reason at all: an abstract, "good thing".

Business cheat:
* To state God must not bring "punishment and rewards", but act out-of-scope, to be scientifically spiritual, is wrong: spiritual system must follow the chain of cause and effect.
* That karmic law does not occur, where short-term calculation sees it's gain and loss in reverse because the long-term effect overrides this, because of "spiritual goodness" is wrong.
* That in natural cure, one needs to ask no money because nature would pay it or even, baseless: a man who does not want to pay is doing business cheat himself, not his healer.
  * The case of cheating must be real.
  * We cannot teach some people to live without money because it's not possible.

In our real experience of spiritual realm, we are learning to go towards long-term gains:
* We build tax system to achieve this miraculous ability to run without money; we must prove this system based on actual income and how it propagates, and how seeing the big picture allows us to break the rules of a small pixture.
* This states we always say governor must pay, but then the people must use their gain from provision wisely, and collect money to have this tax. For tax-payer, good and bad occurs less, they are not punished for accident loss. This should be basis for modern society, an ethical thing but not getting money from nowhere.
* God is summa summarium, sum of the whole, and as the whole is made of parts: accumulated pain and pleasure determine the pain and pleasure of the whole, which indeed rather does pay back.

Real miracles:
* Life: on short term science, very improbable to appear; it contains spirit - overcoming the short-term laws of matter to achieve long-term efficiency, which is the function of life itself.
* Love: true love gets enornomous efficiency from it's long-term gain, such as cocreativity and children; it's naturally able to "pay", to make people "dance", who see the reality of life.
* A sudden, unexpected help for a deserving poor is a miracle; providing food and shelter are miracles of bible and buddhist stories.
* Seeing that long-term gain behind series of events in short term, patterns in the dance, is called enlightenment and it's the source of such miracles.

Miracle is not one-man story, with money coming from nowhere, but it's a stuggle to get a long-term life, called *mind*, and to evidently see yourself as part of bigger picture. God, is more or less, but definitely symbolics of this ultimate, biggest term gain.

We need not to believe this:
* That we are sitting inside the box, and the long-term things come from outside, unreasoned and to be "believen".
* That spiritual and religious people must have no money or ask payment for their service: payment is wrong, if the service is wrong or if it's too much; the cheat happens in atheist side if they state the good payment is not paying at all: the story, that materialist *does* take money and religious *does not* already expects the long-term gains are very reasonably used, and some kind of collective money exists by which they *still pay it all over long terms*.
  * This is not lack of rationality, but the ultimate rationality, if you *collect money for **all** of your work, and **complete** money, without anybody paying on single basis, locally*. A saint is perfect with money: able to survive with less, but not taking it from the air.

We need to differentiate between:
* Long-term gain or no gain at all, a "miraculous" process: let's not believe in miracles.
* Cheating with money or not asking it at all: it's reasonable to ask good money.
* Expecting extreme efficiency: it's as improbable as in business, where miracles happen sometimes: companies with very good earnings and no bad side-effects.

Normally, in christianity and buddhism, we need to work for what we get, and we need to get for what we work. The long term is not a "hidden mystery", but when miracle occurs: it's not sudden break of natural law, but you would know it enough to *gain it with* the natural law.
