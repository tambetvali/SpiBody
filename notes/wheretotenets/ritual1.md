# A post-ritual for Buddhist and Taoist Tenets

After watching the movie of Bodhidharma and asking, what would be some today's ritual? Well as a rather futuristic (here, this means with some precognition of this lawful, essentially determinant fluid) cognition of Mind:

What if you create a statue of Bodhidharma and connect it, made of Steel, hermetically to the ground - this would symbolize the firm state as the Emperior Guards came to remove him to offer "merits" to the emperor; because the emperor claims to have merits. This institution of the merits, removing him, still could not walk as well as he stands, and completely failed the running - they were simply uncut by one monk from his firm stance. Where is the futuristic energy and vision, a precognition of this sentence? Wuxia, in our symbolic interpretation - as we are not into very good vision and precise philosophies into any of the Siddhis of the Siddhas, which would be in reality very similar to these Wuixa movements; which are mere technological make-ups or illusions in our world of screens, targeted to hit the symbolic world. Where, for a Saint, *karmic force* is told to act clearly - for he makes all the mental, physical and spiritual movement; mental is of mind, physical is of body and it's consciousness, spiritual is for Christians, the mind towards God (for some funny reason if I asked for united training books of body, mind and spirit, while psychosomatic training gave some western "masterpieces" like - "The Mind Illuminated", "A complete meditation guide", where this 578 page freely available book is for physical explanation of meditations, and the union of western brain science and meditation is little bit dumb for east, unspecific for west, so both can practice theirs better; but I see some jewish influence and jews actually have such very literal belief systems they somehow convert - perhaps you need some introduction to some jewish thought for initiation or something; you cannot take the book too literally but rather it's a "philosophical speculation"; an our own Buddhist work is "The Awakening Body", "Somatic Meditation for Discovering our Deeper Life" by Reginald A. Ray and Shambala press - it has meditation method for body fitting mine, which means I have done some Buddhist training for mind; Buddhist helps you to recognize the Mind, but then turn to Taoist to make it recognize the Body - this means, train it for holistic health -, finally as you have Mind and Body turn to Christian or Confucian: either speculate about society, like a 33-year old man, or start working and doing after some philosophical considerations: confucius has one personal Philosophy book, in tradition of Marcus Aurelius and Christ, and work on Chinese theoretical sciences such as I Ching; I personally think there is some transcend meaning why Kung Fu and Confucius sound so similar - because they were movements for internal work and war, and external work and war, to do all these four [a fractal head] most peacefully, fruitfully and still solid); for a Buddhist, Spiritual is the way to Siddhis, such as the one of Siddhas, and for us westerners it's the philosophical and all-encompassing view of the sciences and mathematics of the constitutional laws in a realm, where we currently have seen the police only in blind-walking states with "right to be stupid or forgiveness in what they don't see"; we are happy if it's the civil realm they won't reach - otherwise, you could recognize the dangerous blindness or stupidity, lack of proper exercise and intent; where in the U.S. soldier's guide I found the beginning statement that Spiritual is to be Right in God, Society and the Self: "The Spiritual Fitness Manual" "By Chaplain (Major) Mark R. Johnston, United States Army, Editor", which targets spiritual fitness in duty: well I did read the introduction about definitions of those three terms; these materials seem to be freely available, ChatGPT suggested this for download, but I think if you go much further than the introduction explantion, you might be already contemplating over militarie's own dimensions - still if you ask Christian what is the Spiritual Fitness in terms of Confucian action, the emerging Christian idea of God, People and Self, with all in their proper places, generally gives the more official version of "Spiritual", where "Chosen Ones" loosely connects groups, where Christian "Spirituality" are defined for civil life purposes: it means the general fit of philosohies of each nation. "To Follow God" => "You Are Spiritual" this implication relates to Spirituality in where you *actually do*, where *actually* doing is the Spiritual asset, where you might be right in theory and it's applications, but not that you actually achieve "That You Follow God" - recognize this is Christian-Confucian asset and for Taoist of Buddhist, we do not follow the course of Nations and the Worlds, or Heavens thereof or without, but Taoist defines "we believe in God, but God in personal life is called Tao", this is because the whole in you, is not the whole - it's rather empty like matter -; U.S. Soldiers have previously defined their war is "The Holy War of Christ", and here the Spirituality then refers to actuality of the Whole, while the common Spiritualism relates the same philosophical scrunity and highness of the goal to more personal, where Chrown chakra relates our lives to aspects, rather than wholes: this is Spirit, it exists in aspects and it's whole is somehow random. Notice that both Jewish-like thinkers or the Military might want the "fair use" of their texts whatever they mean, and not whatever I mean: you should rather understand, why those texts exist.

Okay but in our creative ritual: we are now busy at stating the statue of Boddhidharma.

A Tractor should symbolize the emperor's guards: the trick is that if you take a rope, perhaps even a metal rope or metal-strenghtened rope, you cannot still move the statue, which is very strongly connected to the ground. Ground might be mud, sand etc. instead of asfalt, stone or metal: very strongly connected tractor might be more complicated incident.

Finally, you have to break only one chain, or two sides of the ropes (as in the movie) and you leave the tractor going away and perhaps struggling to slow down the wheels.

Well and then this is the modern-world Boddhidharma ritual, which fits into the scene in the movie.

It's the funny thing about constructive rituals. If every movement has a meaning: we have materialized one meaning.
