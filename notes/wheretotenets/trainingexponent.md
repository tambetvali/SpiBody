# Training the Exponent: Exponential Training

You train more by exponential factor, moving from 0 to 1 and from 1 to infinity, where 1 represents a small finite number this is O-notation with exponent syntax, where in this document I simplified it at all; the from 1 to infinity creates infinity-symmetric pattern where you are initially at random, later at experience-influenced pattern as the global pattern comes through in every reasonable direction. You are part of the whole, all, the totality; you are also the whole of your parts and the identities of your bodies and personalities or a person; your Selves or Self: integrated into multiple dimensions, scales or frequencies; Ego: initially the limitations, later the love for your self, your body, mind, success and place in this reality; Superego: you think in social reality; Id: I relate to idea, initial bliss where you idealize your ethernal position and recognize the symbolic meaning of your lifetime - in childhood, the infinity (your one lifetime is kind of infinite, for example, it's your own infinity of personal time in present points on moment-energy contiinum). In space of infinities: you grow higher.

We use the O-Notation for optimization goals, which states:
- When the division of our training patterns into numerous singular groups of exercises, this individuation of muscle, extensible towards infinity to grasp complex patterns over lifetimes; to have fine-gained ininity of length of your spiritual life, which involves the lifetimes: you visualize your life is random element in higher tree, and you start optimizing from randomization of the factor, where are you there - the karmic patterns of your actual I, which is felt so differently by Chrown chakra, it's the appearance of your I-sensations in the whole karmic pattern of the Universe, where your deeper goals, meanings and personalities or characteristics are meant to appear over and over. It is not Zen and Tao to have a solid experience of this as singular souls reincarnating; the Zen leaves open what you got from the Senses, and accepts this change or surrenders: these sensations are Empty; while Tao is doing this with your Decision or Will: it changes between opposites and their estimations, where your altering your mind about these decisions, choices of decisive values, form the Formless, Empty Tao: in philosophy, it does not have a philosophical form; it's the Motion in the Universe and in Tao you go Straight, constantly revaluating your *decisions*. Linearly shaped groups of exercises create the O(1) notations, where "1n" or "2n" or even "100n" would be linearly growing; thus we can add several exercises in linear frequential space or dimension, which we should be aware of with our body. Where each segment of the fractal extends outside (I-E dimension) as fast as it *a priody* does into inside, we double each leave or unitary part of the fractal: the middle or first half fime we do the local groups, then the outside quarters or respectively the second half we use to order the outer patterns *starting from exterior*. In this linear dimension, if we choose random numbers for balancers of each dimension, imagining our karma is related to several lives of our-like vibrations or waves or frequencies or their patterns, or it's related to generations of people: they gave birth to us, physically mentally and spiritually, and we give birth to them, who come after; our karma exterior is also related society, and to which philosophies we practice or study, where only in the whole process we study rather our whole, which is the fractal piece of the Whole.
- When the division involves exponent, this is where it's complicated: we have to remove numerous members from multiplications and stick to additions, for example with positive numbers (the simplest example). This O(1^n) would similarly symbolize 1n^n pattern, which is exponentially going into exponent, where first-level growth is shaped like exponent factor "^n", and the "1n", which is kind of more linear, but in our fractal the exponent part is repeated only slighly in each iteration or part - so, how the 1n grows in relation to symmetric growth of applied exponent, is a separate component to show the extension space to make the bigger function be curved in infinity itself; this has superdimension with numbers starting from near-zero and keeping the slowdown effect of it's action long before it starts speedup or accelerate approaching it's infinities; these are underthreshold rhythyms, which create eventual whole signals and suddenly create flashes of knowledge, like irrational element of enlightenment (spiritual), illumination (physical) or study of theory (mental) - subthreshold attention, over experience, will multiply into it's repeating patterns, which will be heavily visible.

Exponent is this:
- You do an exercise for only one repetition.

Between 1 or 2 repetitions, 7 or 8 repetitions, even 1 or 10 repetitions: the factor of performance is lineraly growing, each repetition can be measured in terms of previous repetition or states. Only a number of repetition of infinity properties, which can already have octave-harmony energy counterparts in lower dimensions; for example if 4 repetitions could already be a little disturbance in higher infinity, where the tiredness and healing up or enstrenghtening and enflexing or empowering would simply work like "la" in bass and tremble / or high-pitch frequency, a thriller or the sound of fast-paced society, or Christian's spiritual yelling: even your muscle can do this sound instead of breaking, if it's their experience of existance or it's physical meaning; the reality resolves meanings in long experiences and acts of intelligence and creativity once the pattern of development endeepens: this, mathematically, comes from square-infinity-compatible patterns. Following closely, in real time, the patterns of how you get tired or muscle-death-feared, the comfortable zone of your development: you are free about the strength and weakness patterns, and with 1/4 or 1/16 part of exercise being intense patterns about this relevant strength hidden there, and the rest big part would be low-intensity repetitions of the weakness patterns: stable distribution already involves now the central patterns and higher-oscillative patterns, such as becoming tired in days, months, weeks and years: in those units, you need to have fractal levels for this question: for example, how many times you do the whole exercise cycle, with all repetitions, in a week? Now you see where you get advantage and gain of your experience, related to your past coordinates ("past" also means the imaginary "low" to optimize the metarepetitions of language a little bit): if your mathematical imagination, coming from your creativity and intelligence or well-visualized movies of exercise and it's patterns on various levels; one half now in additional space needs to be chaotic movements with especially small force: these cover both the exponent of randomness and probability of each point on continuum: over lifetimes, or through experience and it's deepening, aspects of Physical Consciousness or Fractal Theory Consciousness; we approach the Continuous Plane of Movement: where the movement range is completely trained, instead of having a set of railroads where we prefer to move without becoming tired or being weak.

We see in each dimension we connect the whole with the local: we become holistic, and being present is fractally in Moebius-like switch from the largest whole to the pattern of smallest parts: holistic and local is fractally interwined, like a complex system of synapses, connections of Matrix Units of Mind and Body and the Theoryfushion of Body and Mind - the principles spreading into how they fit all, where reincarnation theory only repeats the inside-life dimension in deeper intensity, where gold-rush would see different, more local principles compared to the whole of the level; we apply the same ethical principles and we are calm and not rushed or in excess of need or energy - rather, we work out and in our energy and confirm our basic needs.

Root and Crown chakra opposites:
- In Crown chakra you move in society and reality and it's meaningful system; the energy floats as you raise: you rise as you create positive vibes and waves. When you let others take parts of things, apply in organizations and work: you give away this credit. This is the system of credits, which provides our higher guidance: here, all the physical laws work in opposite direction, upwards. To "do good" in higher frequencies: let people help you, break this energy equilibrum where you pretend to be cold body and you consume this energy; instead of doing the work of others, removing their exercise for karmic consequence: what orbits you, let it also take a part as strongly as you might want to help them.
 - An elderly person would choose, sometimes, roads they cannot pass alone, to let people help them.
 - A girl would sometimes not approach the bridge, but calmly wait a boat at the river, meditating on society and it's pains. This is a visualization meditation: the Zen is whether the boat would ever come; the Tao is to change your decisions as you meet the boats, the workers to work for you and the soldiers to fight for you.
 - Even the undeservant gets a little part in the work. Sometimes, you let a disabled people be a little enabled: they take part of an important task, project or goal. Their growth is an exponent factor.

The easiest exponent:

The easiest exponent is that of Zero and One, or Zero and Finite Number: Repeating an exercise only one time is actually an exponent of many factors, and activates the desire of your body. Complex patterns emerging from one-repetition or around-one-repetition experience as related to exercise with force repetition: this creates an "experience" of this complex or chaotic wave - your body is suddenly illuminated and understands the whole.

The largest exponent:

You create a fractal head of repetitions of exercises, which would encompass the Light and the Dark, and a Solid Continuum of Possible Exercise (in practice, divide to parts - you certanly miss something):
- Upwards it's either your lifetimes, it's also the society and the generations to pass, and the links emerging inside-out to support of one force and it's existence, and the need to support back as well as to take the care back to make the energy grow in a circle and it's surroundings. This basically means: you are, in larger whole of any dimension of growth or distance, in a random point of your continuum, so fractal head takes a random shape; these shapes when randomization is repeated should emerge the same fractal into higher space if you project infinity into finity.
- Downwards you now choose an aspect of the balance of the exercise, and do each.


Imagine this:
From 0 to 1 is basically O(infinity), because however many times you multiply 0 with 0: if it has some positive qualities, it's infinity on real or imaginary scale, or infinity-relations in repeating patterns; so for sole activation of energies, use "one-time-repetition principle" in exercise session, in day, week, month, year or even half of your lifetime: while 1 might also be 2 or 10, some little finite number, it's repetitions are not exponent factor themselves, and less than one is not enough to have that exercise at all. For strength, it's a solid strength, factor "one" of existence of this exercise, but not any excess strength - because now you want to repeat this exponent "infinite number of times", but you have little exponent-positive quality of your moments, with some intensity, and this scales up to infinity as a finite number of repetitions. Imagine your lifetime as one infinity in continuum of moments and their share of energy: circulation of axes is so large that so various times you have felt a touch of infinity, for example infinity in one look into eyes, which might replicate the infinity of moment, information or lifetimes, or numerous axes of life and death, local and social.


Bring a Viking exponent:
- Some empires cover large amounts of lands without being so social. Swedish empire is like Viking empire: it's roots tied and leaves around the world, the business or a vision can form empires, but they coexist purposefully in the same area; indeed, often inside larger empire or necessarily the global civilization and it's laws. Corporations, then, are the Swedish Luxury Empires: while I've heard right now it's not going so well as the children play the rage against the empires; normally it is normal that every wiking has won every other viking: in case you do your part, somehow everybody is in his war, already conquered each person and heavily strong, even in society; this is a paradox of victory how can everybody be conquered and the conquerors. For example, in each Russian also sounds the Russian Empire, or Federation - in many people it's standing straight, in their inner and exter peace and wartimes (my word is exter because it makes sense sounding well); it's the quality that people are somehow dangerous and intense, while fitting near to their personal, social and ultimate surroundings of fit to other experiences in places, times and lifetimes of us of our ancestors: how we don't know the shape of Mind or Minds in the Universe, and what is the part breaking and forming new identities, or the part or parts remaining, we know that they align in principle and similarity of their own natures, and form a fractal of unities: one Formless Void being their Total Union, where the Fractal Head here does not give a monotone pattern with Even Edges; what we are fighting for is an abstract pattern, an essential Void, so as Matter and Mind.
- Either you fight others down, or yourself up: you can see how up and down directions move in special dimension of social and shared ups and downs, and exploration or pioneering of untravelled territories of body, mind and the social body of higher dimensions, which vibrates and guides you. Chistian is research of Philosophy, Confucian is the Application of this Body which is not the church.

If you empower each person, you have some philosophy of battle: you are amongst the battle, where it's touching you and acting upon the potentials, you contemplate the outcome dimensions: "they are strong" then does not fear you, neither makes you hope, but you earn and lose both in the global and local: Chrown and Root. People cannot go like wolves to grasp the sharpest appearances and even illusions of helping others, society, earth or ethereality: we provide each others with such exercise of making earth a better place of them, where them is either oneself, or the overself which is relating to their karmic circulation, inside-our the blackside-white dimension, where the oscillation of distinct needs and offerings turn it into colors with Void, abstract meanings: I need precisely Chicken, you need precisely Eggs, where combinations to provide one to another are not price-related, black and white images, but complex, Void shapes of vibrations. This is the Right Side: there is the Left Side, where fractals of these patterns raise in vibrations until they create fluidums of metadinensions not ever associated with singularities of persons; still, as every moment exists in so many dimensions - giving a chicken, you might give health, energy or invitation ability; the Left mathematical dimension is otherwise having similar relations to Right, but inside the solid space of paradigms and their energies related to O-Notations and optimums: it's called "Negative Force", which is producing this fusion, because the Infinity, when it's effects considered Locally, leave the wicked witch trace, which would bend this rather to local effects: wizardly trace would follow the dimension, even where it seems negative, and still lead the local; as the dimension or meaning of it is slowly drifting and shifting, it creates different balances of gains and loans and their two counterparts: who got and who is paying back is continuously in alternation. The "Positive Force" are clear Good things vs. clear Bad things: you won't get lost in "Latin Latin" or Binary System; but found in Laegna Latin: for example the local-global generalized binary system; Laegna Laegna: the quaternal system of two binary opposites - this union of several forces does not provide the sensory pleasures so much, in lokamums (from "loka" and "local optimums" / or could be "locanums" if it's all a set of physical "numbers" or "nambers" in extension of my language) of mathematics.

# Practice of Dimensions

You can imagine:
- A free-form dance, even Traditional Style or Coreographic Dance of the script, each provides exponent factor of union of Mind, Body and Meaningful External Influence.
- A relaxation, random patterns with low-intensity muscles.
- A complex pattern of Tai Chi or Qi Gong: not repeating clearly symmetrical, monotone-repeating patterns, but rather forms with deeper meaning or complexity, where rhythym appears beyond this.

Fractals and spirituality are involved, so each three provide a spiritual dimension of these.
