# Raising to Eternity - locally

We train ourselves in Mind and Body: to take eternal and local course.

A paradigm of matter, body, cells: that the eternal angles, the infiny angles, are real, and basically each sensible process as it enlightens, behaves in respect to them. For examples, forces of physics could learn about eternal energies and be yielded in regards: this can happen in complex process, such as human.

Our whole posture indeed has more angles than each separate direct angle of us - the machine, indeed, moves in directions more complex than straights.

We see that in infinity angles, every motive for a natural law, or for a response, will remain the same; as we behave with matter and mind, in regards to those external angles, they will "materialize" in sense that the most efficient solutions, indeed, become true.

Then: we need to build a body, which has not only local matter, cells, tissues, muscles etc., but where we bring the eternal, the infinite, to this low level to act like a matter. This is materially complex but notice: it *already is* that, in sense that the chains of evolution, organization of matter, punishment and reward in cells and organisms - in all this, the effects of infinite slowly progress to take an effect. To only train these infinite effects means to materialize them - imagine you have a body and a matter, in respect to infinity, as solid and stable as your real body; this is what is materializing - mathematically, in synchrone in matter, cells, organs and other levels of existance / organization.

The same way, locally material substance will appear in infinity: it does not follow them in ideals, but in particulars. Such way, the "godly spirit" will fall down on Earth, our ethical laws are not mere generalizations, then, but turn into particulars as we awaken such "Godly consciousness" of actually calculating that way.

## Biology and matter

In local virtual plane, then from atoms to cells, on each level, the reactions of infinity goals are direct; the infinity-relation, once the energies balance and equilibrium appears, create a duplicated plane for each essential law of matter, biology and other spheres or realms; the same way, local effects should appear directly in infinity (in a plane, where it's calculations take place).

This is the natural direction, and notice: no additional "planes" or "space" is needed, but it's rather a *settling* of these things; it happens naturally be the Law, the very same laws you already have: it's implied only from the fact that *mathematics is real*, discovering a real plane; you can think: interrelations on infinity plane are real interrelation, with real energies in play.
