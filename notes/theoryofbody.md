# Theory of your Body

Your body, as you exercise, grow and live in general, is acting like a fractal of theories - not only the direct force, but also the relation towards cause and effect, and similar causes and effects, occur.

This happens in several ways:
- Through experience and knowledge.
- Through starting the initial element production for each specific kind of development.
- By the similar forces in one part of body relying on similar forces of other parts - each part relies, on it's own force and flexibility or other attributes, on force and flexibility and other attributes of others.

This means, in various ways:
- Each force you develop in parts of your body, has logic to get into your whole body, starting from closer.
- Focused, intense energy to develop one part of your body activates heightened end-knowledge in your body and mind, so that you get much better visions about your evolutionary possibilities, as well as very sharp energy speads from a point.

Your local theory is each exercised part, and the global theory with more precise angles "to infinity" - your general training, where each part, whether it moves all 90 degrees or a few degrees, adds to the holistic whole: this whole starts developing major axes, which necessarily have more degrees than locally possible.

## Metaphysics

Imagine you train your body in regards to all things you don't know, or which are arbitrary in deeper cause and effect. You train the angles of mundane, everyday reality - but you reach their limit values, which represent ideal theories, the ideal world. This means you physically do something like a crown chakra - from this physical material, where the complexity of your movement can be called your theory or theories, you assimilate certain sense of ideality in your movement, in regards of higher realities above, or lower beyond, those theories.

This basically means: you do not develop your body not only in regards to current situation, but in regards to changes in your life; then, you train your life to be more flexible - it approaches a general theory, not a deep focus on your current situation.

Body, which has learnt a theory, should have better automatic growth and healing functions, as it definitely starts doing what it knows.

## Metaphysical past training

In past, much of your training might have reached dead ends - the pain, given the abilities and resources of your body, could not grow in this aspect and remained stuck in the dead end; slowly it adds up to your tiredness of life. Very complex pain and anxiety arrives, which definitely needs you to get up.

You have to train all the basic tracks of developments and grow the theory, which could have helped you back then - you train bones, train muscles, etc., in ways which could have been necessary to prepare for this training.

While your present-day training often means "situational muscles" and you can lose such focus, so that the muscles go away; something deeper, in forms of theories and developed centers and movements, remain in your muscles - repeadedly changing focus so that well-developed muscles can be lost, somewhat, and are fought back in different, or the same, forms: this is what could happen even between summer and winter, and which you need to see as normal part of your development. These are "non-situational muscles", ready to appear faster and faster, even in matter of days, as you train or need them; by such agility of training, the whole system starts to train training itself, which results in square input => output factor, an exponential factor on your development and use of muscles.

Each thing you gave away as it took force away from your exercise - it's a candidate to train it separately as well, so that you also grow by growing your danger zones into safer places; you develop a sense through moving on highways to get there, and in nature to get there anyway.

Now, as you create the structures, intents and answers your body would have needed in past, to not disable a part of you or fail it's development - with new energy, this latent tiredness will become alive, and those systems need very little exercise to become awake, moving and energized; to actually do this growth.

It starts from muscle, which is closer to simple repetitions - but the actual complexity of your being tired, unskillful and unable gets to very complex patterns, and these are not mere brain structures. Each pattern can invoke resistance from complex set of factors, and needs specific training - you make it more metaphysical, like a theory not like a single practice, if you practice in a way that the exercise of each move will not remain in this very specific move, but different exercises give body a more generic fact, a factor of tiredness, pain and shame it will use all throughout the body, and signal to others, to grow up the whole complex it has learnt.

To understand this, answer this question: what the body really needs from you to grow? Exercise, for example, fills the caps of certain information, as well as they raise the criteria to remain in "normal condition".

Exercise of the sick - as long as the sickness is in early stages, it might repeat without meeting any resistance; once it gets heavy, you get energy into it and build a strong resistance, which also heals the chronic aspect - it will also be enabled from always coming back (I said "disabled" backwards, as "enabling", in my language, could mean a positive condition).

So you also train theories, and speed up processes, which are already there: complex kind of tiredness can fade away at the same time, when the pain is growing smaller. The long-forgotten dreams of Life and Emotion, they can start coming up again - the chronic ill left in regards to them, starts to heal, and you can grow *very* complex features on your body, which you could feel, for example, as muscle and nerve of your whole; this can be very complex, where the system is broken, but all these pieces are needed to move you as a whole; there is the web of interconnectedness: each muscle, for example, goes to the next muscle.

It's interesting that childhood and youth muscle can be out of your reach, disabled for various reasons - you was, for example, more flexible as a child, and able to focus your power. Reaching back to those areas with your exercise, you will recognize the tracks been trained as a child, and you continue something long-forgotten.

## Why I call it a theory?

As your body is changing, it does not have to learn to know it's new movements (despite, sometimes it needs to grow nerves for coordination - to feel the right dispositions of body parts, the right positions and moves); normally, your movement in it's whole complexity will change along, and you do not have a single question of what to do with your new muscle, as you train.

The body is like a perfect Zen: while it would doubt, whether it was different before, it knows very well it's current situation. It knows it so well that perhaps, you have the same amount of power with your body - it's not interested at all in your plans and long terms, but it's intent to do the current thing perfectly is very high, and you would guess it really gets everything done, just as you.

Then, these complexes, which appear, could be directly called knowledge.

As you do one thing for long, the ability will concentrate on this mapped area: this, I call focus or attention. When you switch things, this focus or attention would move - the way you know your past skills, is different, and your body can very well doubt whether it had them.

## Taste of One

This is not enough if you see training and learning, such as aquiring skills, as separate processes. While they need somewhat different input, providing different results - the simple movement in regards to complex movement, it has clear traits shared, where different aspects of one can be termed with aspects of another. They cannot be viewed as separate systems with no complex integrations - rather, the low-frequency (training, skills) and high-frequency (skills, knowledge), they come back in various ways all over the fractal of your life.

## Metaphysics of Eternity

As you train into your body those complex angles, you get flexible in eternity: metaphysics, basically, recollects a fact, which is for ever repeating; you can be trained towards and in regards to those facts, starting, each time, from training the local situation - focus of the fact.

Here, the main goal becomes evident - you train your body, directly, into the logic of infinity, so that you move on infinity axes. "Infinity", here, does not have to be a big thing: for example, an old man has trained 3-year cycles; as you train the cycles, you take limit values for the movements, which means angles straight to infinity, or which means a generalization of your theory.

In this, where there are very practical moves, for example, you can also reach their symbolic extremes: if body understanding is what it *is*, then by some means you need to grasp in you: it can *be* a vehicle on / of your infinite drive, not only the answer to the current situation.

Just as the logic will close in your brain, into a generalized fact not really representing life: the movement ability in your body should close the same way.
