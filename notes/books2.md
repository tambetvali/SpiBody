# Some more books

Holistic and wide - Sri Trailinga Swami; he inspired me to search some Yogi books, because I got an interest into the features on his popular picure. He was claimed to be immortal, and from the picture - he definitely had an interesting body of training.

# The Taoist experience - an anthology by Livia Kahn

This books relates to some kind of similar way; for example "Cosmic Body".

# The Doctrine of Vibration - An Analysis of the Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism by MARK S. G. DYCZKOWSKI

What Hindus say about Vibration.

# Daoist Body Cultivation - Traditional Models and Contemporary Practices - edited by Livia Kohn

This also covers Yoga.

# Light on Yoga - B.K.S. Iyengar

On the picture, you see that training gets the body as strange as the one of Swami; different yogis on pictures got into different features.
