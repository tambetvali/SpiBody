Notice: to make your thinking more free, I do not use same definitions in each text, rather I give definitions as needed to cover the fractal of theories (multiparadigm).

# Attention

Attention is the scope you are currently able to use to solve your questions.

Physical attention is the possible movement of you, where you have clear coordination - trained equilibrium. It also has a blur-out area around. You would notice the solutions in this area, and they are also visible in others. You would know what the eyes mean.

It's the enlightened area of your movement.

# Awareness

Awareness is the result of Attention, that you are basically aware of many other areas, where you can turn your attention. Objects in your awareness are gravity to your attention.

Physical awareness means you train close complexes and areas, movements and their systems, partially: nearby positions are very close to being trained. You move your attention by training further. Awareness scopes to where you can train, especially if your body is responding to this knowledge. Slowly, you move your awareness or extend it, and by life, it often shrinks or fades away - real Zen is in accepting all the forward, yielding, and backward movement in time (progress), where you get the natural rhythym of getting and losing abilities. What Christ would say "you got them from God": many abilities programmed into your body are executive only when outer realities, starting from society, are floating aboard; imagine the facial muscles or the process for sound harmonics.

It's the enlightened area of your progress.

# Consciousness

When you grasp *one* object with whole Attention, you become Conscious of *all* objects of that type. Grasping this with meditations on partial attention can take time - consciousness is Void and you start getting them from nowhere.

Physical consciousness is how your body starts to float with factors you don't have to be aware of: your body starts to train your training programs, and moreover, starts to train without special intent. Whole of your range of potential activity has some degree of consciousness - for example, your movement might indicate that there is some possibility; as you body learns enough stretches, for example, it might yearn towards each possible stretch at all: the feelings you get might cover this opportunity better and better.

For consciousness, paradox should be applied: Mine, while you have it to Awaken, was Awaken all the Time.

It's the enlightened area in your core.
