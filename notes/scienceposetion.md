# Scientific Posetion

I use a logic, logecs word "Posetion" if a fact follows from itself; it's a certain miscoordination in mathematical time. It's the one based on it's own implication.

Imagine a Medievial Time. Imagine a normal person:
- Done extensive head training, believing it's good for thinking.
- Done extensive training on health issues, and use of natural medicine.

Imagine a scientific test done on such people, in a world where even city people mostly come from countryside:
- Head training does not affect such person much.
- Medicaments, natural cure, health training is not such a big deal, even if coming from China or India - they had even this quite commonly done.

Now imagine the current situation:
- Head training: zero.
- Body training: hammer method, "brute force".

What this implies:
- Head training: removes problems of blood circulation, muscular inner massage, breathing and other kinds of coverage. Situation of headache *does not* let us think: while here-mentioned parts of training are targeting *head as biological organ*, not it's metaphysical thought system, one can see that *head shares common criteria of good health with body, period* - to think in this metaphysical space, and especially to think using whole-head power, one needs to do at least a minimum amount of exercise.
- Body holistic training as well has zero experience - our people normally *do fail* with organs, which were trained and strong, *harder to fail*, back then.

We can say that artificial medicine is quite good in urgency situations, but it's not doing *so much more* related to a sailor, who cut his own leg in circumstance of poisoning, for example: surgery is even so natural.

My criticism to medicine:
- Medicaments meant to remove mental pain make one so dull that it's an archetype of mad person: actually we just detect the sympoms of a medicament. Handling of adventure, pain, danger, with proper mindset - a shaman would come out of this pain or artificial conditioning.
- Pain killers could remove: motivation to heal, as well as mental ability to choose from pains. While strong men did not take pain killers, it's not completely reasoned: what makes the *weak* **better** in this case? Which kind of goodness is expressed in being moody and unable to take a dosage of reality?

People, who lack pain, have multiplicity of problems:
- Winning the pain in heart could become ignorance towards others, and certain magic in life: often, it's done deliberately.
- Winning the pain in stomach might mean one won't grow into *emotions*, which could be expressed in keeping the body balance with leg muscles.

The medical results that certain exercises do not solve certain health problems: in times of most of this work the solutions were common, and part of healthy life cycle. In current times, when the body lack much of capability for full life, such training *would* remove the weakness in those organs, and each organ needs a blood circulation, air and physical massage.

We use our muscles inside and outside: body often requires us to do a certain move to remove pain, or does it on it's own. We can see the body positions, as well as muscle work, which does not change positions: the inner and outer condition, by our body building, is synchronized, so that normal daily activities produce the side-effect of internal work; hence we often change styles or do some "fun" with our positions.

# Medicine

We do need to exercise, physically, the internal muscles. It takes awareness meditation of body, as well as learning it's movements. We should not do this much: do one exercise with brain, organs of body etc., or do it a few times; when the organs get tired, normally you lose this ability: even if you do not, be careful that those parts of body: where they do have motor systems, those systems are not comparatively strong to start with heavy training; trust this fear.

Organs, indeed, do need *some* movement to do a lot.

# Scientific Karma

Many scientific tests want to measure a karmic effect.

While western magic was often based on Solar Plexus: magic of Will and Thought, coming from Self, expressing itself in terms of "power", "control" etc., can be black or white very easily - the material of thought is like plastic, used by one's own good. This is the basis of our technology and engineering: I do not accuse the magicians and that time of priests in using the machine, but their very theory after alchemy and shamanism was that Universe is a machine, and we can be capable using it's movement logic.

While this kind of magic could be initially tested by scientists, it could produce karmic effect of disappearing.

Eastern miracles are based mostly on Heart - notice that it's not *better* than Science of the Self, efen if the magic and science, it's development, could be black or white; it's the Power of Mind. This power takes effect by connecting the Karmic relations - the fundament or foundation - and not the Object Logic. People have asked me for such magic - when I was child, I developed Self and learnt Western magic a lot; right not I am practicing Magic of Mind - normally, a magic of Religion. In this magic, one cannot do without karmic consequence: the *basis* of this is karmic consequence. I was told, then I cannot help *them* with such magic, for they need a direct evidence of what they ask for - my method, very well, is based on Flow, and it's not falling together in unitary logic.

Notice the atheist person who would now say one must not do magic of Solar Plexus, because it could be used for bad - I have seen such "teachers", who read my warning and try to teach it. Solar Plexus is critical for awakening and an atheist, seeing the objective (of things) and subjective (of people) world is trying to express their *experience* in such relations: you hear this danger in the level of their world. We do not poison the nature, actually, so much - the black magician, who is able to poison the whole ecosystem, is actually more like a fiction, and you will see many physical objects and machines, as this chakra enables this. It is not good, if an atheist is living along and compassionating with doubts on our face - those doubts are too easy to come, to be compared with analogous looks in their face, usually present in deep experience.

A side-effect of this part: consider the "warning", and then how it could be read: it's scientific posetion if they are contra our realms, and try to explain us our warnings. Warnings, in the healthy, scientific (I mean, our open-minded spiritualism and it's fundamental logic) world belongs to anticipiating the crisis, and the societies, where people themselves luckily run around with such problems and produce them: it's way too criminal if they measure our emotions that way, like as if we were little insects, in their "distribution of believability", who want to "gain something". We do not want to gain "something", but we want to gain it All, and you know what means All.

I have seen this paradigm:
- Based on vague interpretations of Powers of Thought and Will - most often described as the ones, which were used arbitrarly, like machines ("Your Secret Invisible Force You Aren't Taking Advantage Of (Energy = Magic) - NO BS guide" - watch this in youtube, to discern the magic of Self from the magic of Mind); we see these people being the adapts for such thought: if we cannot use our powers in their direct advantage, we must pass through some "scientific mismatching"; indeed, if we are talking about Magic of Mind, they need to do this mismatch: right after they think it's not karmic. Mind magic does not have such "side-effect" that karmic course would affect it, but it's *based solely on karma*. This is the Buddhist "magic".
- The Problem people, indeed, would not learn the point of this to *not mess with magic*, but would start warning us, especially me, in magic of Self, to get me on my own way - I hear, from authoritative sources, so many complaints on things I discuss, based on simplifications on my conclusions: for example, if I describe peaceful war, a Christian barbar would tell "war is not peaceful", which is true if they themselves attack the peaceful war with weapons: I am *not* discussing their conception, nor mentioning it, and the *common-person effect* does not happen somewhere magically; they told to me that "practicing peaceful war leads, by mental effects, to aggressor war"; we must notice the bad experience these people had when they started to follow our philosophy - their pretensions enabled rights, things, which are constitutional rights based on what we can do, and what is done - this kind of camouflage is a pretension: constitutional laws, yes, but not the constitutional laws of robbery capitalism, because the balanced market, whatever it is, is based on need, personal need; a direct guided honour, where democracy is not lost, has an ever-going war "against Satan", which is classically described as war against a hypothetical entity, representation of multiple traits; if a Christian-based country has an atheist, who does not believe in war, in the war of christ: they do believe that they attack those warriors with muscles and weapons, and the situation invites to kill them right away; such an atheist cannot believe we do not have a reason: they ask, what is your motivation?
 - Atheism pretends it has disproven "enlightenment": using so general terms that it has to do with our common necessity to grow and develop ourselves; and it's hard to distinct from me, how it for example does not relate to university degree.
 - Atheism, by people such as Undo Uus, has sometimes disproven existence of any cognitive experience, and it's funny to see science, which proves that we are all dead - notice that the question "if we are all dead, are you then dead?" is insulting as well, because it serves as a discrimination.
 - Atheism, sometimes, proves that love, synergy etc. lack those extreme highs, which are felt; notice that when those break barriers seen as physical laws - the constitution, here, is double-edged, as I mentioned: the realm you enter, where constitution is based on left-wing protection of the laws; if we go further with the laws, we protect much more, and we come closer to each others: I cannot come closer if the atheists are so "equal" to be as close as anyone, and to protect their right to appear peaceful in any condition, with weapon.

# Notice the Fallacies

Notice those posetive fallacies, coming from "commoner minds":
- They have too many misunderstandings in matters, and they do want to express this "normality" of themselves by creating a "common ground". I have seen them miserably bringing their own problems, such as their own levels of poverty or sickness, to other people: for motives such as pretending to be equal and trying to push those people to give away; to give away on strange basis: on bookkeeping so well that it's a different book already, the book of real poor man.
- They also do have rights for a medievial time: counting those abnormalities, such as a non-spiritual person believing in spiritualism under non-scientific basis; in name of "danger", an atheist would call any spiritual claim a lie, roughly based on Mark Twains description on how the Pope is robbing money. While atheist, as well, if they improperly understand, what is real and what is fake, in both directions the monetary loss is equal: if they are discussing those people, who are humble like us, and discussing this mostly inside, like us, and not trying to be a teacher of a poorman, like us: notice that lack of this university degree, or governmental lack of degrees to measure sensitives either equally, or to have reason, which could tolerate truth and lies: this lack of intelligence, while in medievial times, common uneducated people were misused by pope and his enemies, the groups of people still protecting themselves agains myths with weapons: where they are not welcome, it's absolutely not necessary that they come to *measure the money*, such as discussing, whether they can win certain amount of money with shaman input, or whether people could be faked into such belief: in cases, where Shaman *is not offering them such money*, assumption that they leave with money, without work, is not an entry point to start doing law exercises and doubt: spiritual people normally know, which spiritual effort they are putting in to get which spiritual gains, and there is no hidden message that you could rob their money or something. The message is very clear: you go though a growth of personality, and commonly, if you are good, you are going to "compete" with people on such road, who *do not* have or promise such excess money lying on the floor: well, books like "Secret" could be seen as exceptions: for this book, one needs to be especially good communicator, and many typical mistakes on the way of synergy are removed; after purification mind: such people recognize each others and really do provide such things as a free lunch. I do not promise you a free lunch: I provide with scientific arguments, which could compete roughly in the field of business theory, and it does not make you a genius; I am really discussing, with intelligent people: if they can understand my argument, they can calculate it with paper and pencil, and they make up some models for themselves based on different arguments; indeed, to teach a hungry idiot, who thinks they secretly leave with all your money - in case you did not tell you would use sorcery to get them guaranteed victory in lottery ..we do believe in synergy and synchronization: but this kind of "magic", that this lovely spiritual girl would give you a million because I have this "magic trick of smile": while we like to smile on street, barely would this even bring this girl to coffee.

Pondering around other people, whether they would give you million for free or not: this is an illegal activity in modern times, currenly containing more dangers than the other way round - offering a free million.

# History

History of our Spiritual Tradition, mostly all the west: we have analyzed the gold rushes, sciences, and even Mark Twain: while not believing in each belief of him, we do believe in all those risks and dangers presented. We believe them as well if scientists are coming with "certain knowledge" that this or that is useless. We use scientific philosophical method to leave things open, and we are able to safely manage this world of probabilities, and to be open with people who consider different realities and intuitions: we do not think those people are ought to "give us something".

# Scientific method

Scientific method is not about being dull:
- Following ethics is not ultimately so much about whether God exists: effects of good karma should not be so expensive to testify. It's not so big deal what you "get" from this: we cannot even pass the test with "getting" and "losing", but it's rather about interchange, about a whole healthy ecosystem and symbiosis: while we cannot achieve each, we can still say it's a good karma to get to those; the verification group, which exists without ecosystem and symbiosis hardly exists in realms of life and even matter - it has reached some equilibrum.
- We are not interested about did you get any effects, practicing Zen. "Effects" in terms of money or even doing hypnosis and sharlatanism: Zen is not so much about this, but it's a paradigm, where we still work and eat, bit we are making it more friendly; the matter of whether the intent to make it more friendly would make it more friendly - it's the matter of whether intent matters at all; it's not so much a matter of whether intent behaves very magically: "magic", in sense of "breaking some natural laws", has been ignored or even fought, and the alchemical transformation of matter and mind into higher forms - it was not without the chemicals and testifications; the science left of alchemy - physics -, by all means tries to change the matter into something higher.

Alchemy, essentially, is going through pleasures and pains of emotions and mind, and letting them naturally go through a process: science cannot say that it's a straight-forward process, like solving a logic puzzle, neither can it say that we are not then doing material processes, by material means, to get those structures more life-friendly and more satisfied in their equilibrum. Science *can* discuss the extremists: but so can we. It's very uneducated to call this "scientific" if mere conception of spiritualism is running solely around some dangerous practices.
- For example, the two seven-year processes of King Salomon were alchemical process.
- Evolution: where complex process is resolving Nature into equilibrium, then not every direct part of this process, but the chaotic contemplation into order is an alchemy.
- It's "mystical", "irrational" process leading from your current situation into something, which naturally resolves and flows: it depends on whatever chaotic constraints are there by the logic of nature or the dynamics of our mind.
- God, definitely, must be having alchemy: even an evolution is such process.

# Monetary Business

These science-minded people are collecting the results of our work, including the results of spiritual process, and distributing them to their "safe group" - excluding, specifically, spiritual people.
