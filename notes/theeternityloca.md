# The Eternity Loca

Barcelona is told to be a city where, when it's poor, people start to help each others; and when it's up, they do not - they become very closed, just running for their own little things, like a small persons.

This is like:
- When you are down, you work to get up.
- When you are up, you work to get down.

This is like a story of the candles to god: in trouble, a rich man promises candles to god, but once he got up, he has another trouble - to not bring candles.

This is like the process of a robber, to reach each rich city, do it's things until it gets poor, surviving a while, and going to next rich city - in a world, where success and failure is not by you, but given; they expect people to get up and raise rich cities so much that they have like a garden.
